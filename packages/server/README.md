# @stim-cli/server

`stim-server` serves Stim state to paired clients, such as the Stim phone app,
and lets the clients the Mac grants control run `stim reload` and `stim stop`
in a workspace. It runs on the Mac, next to Stim. It changes Stim state only
through those two commands. It writes only its own pairing state and action
log under `$STIM_HOME/server/`, and the device recordings described under
[Recording](#recording).

The design is in
[`docs/specs/2026-09-25-stim-server-design.md`](../../docs/specs/2026-09-25-stim-server-design.md).

## Commands

```bash
stim-server [--port <n>]          # serve paired clients, port 7787 by default
stim-server pair [--port <n>] [--control]
                                  # print a single-use pairing payload
stim-server devices [list]        # list paired devices, approved clients and access requests
stim-server devices grant <id> --control|--read|--build|--device-host
                                  # let a paired device run actions, or only read;
                                  # --build approves builds; --device-host approves device hosting
stim-server devices revoke <id>   # revoke a paired device or client, or deny a request
stim-server log                   # list the actions paired devices ran
stim-server service install|status|uninstall
                                  # run stim-server as a macOS LaunchAgent, see below
```

`--env KEY=VALUE` and `--path-prepend <dir>` (each repeatable) apply to the
serving command: see [Run as a service](#run-as-a-service).

`pair --json` prints `{ "qr": <payload>, "expiresAt": "<ISO time>" }`, and
`devices --json` prints `{ "devices": [...] }` with each device's `id`, `name`,
`identity`, `pairedAt`, `lastSeenAt` and `capabilities`, never its token hash,
followed by the [build clients](#build-access) and [device-host clients](#device-host-approval).
New client records carry `requestedCapability` (`build` or `device-host`),
including after approval. Pending records also carry `pendingUntil`; a legacy
pending record without `requestedCapability` is a build request.
`log --json` prints `{ "actions": [...] }`, the records described under
[Actions](#actions).

`GET http://127.0.0.1:7787/health` answers requests from this Mac with the
server's name, versions, protocol, `stimHome`, and the current
Tailscale state. While Tailscale runs, it also carries `route`, read from
`tailscale serve status --json` on each request: `routed` with the HTTPS
`port` that proxies to the server, `funneled` with the Funnel `ports` that do,
`missing`, or `unknown` with a `reason`; the last three carry the `port` the
setup command would use. Stim Desktop uses it to find a running server and
show its route. A request through `tailscale serve` or on a Tailscale address
without an `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site` header, which a web page's request
carries, gets only `{ "server": "stim-server", "version", "protocol" }`, which Stim
Desktop's Build machines list uses to find stim-server on the other Macs of the
tailnet. A request from this Mac with a `Host` other than `127.0.0.1` or
`localhost` gets HTTP 426, like any other plain HTTP request.

`stim-server` runs the `stim` version this package was released with, not the
one on your PATH. It reads the login shell's environment once at start, so
`PATH`, `ANDROID_HOME`, and `STIM_*` variables match your terminal even when
another app starts it.

## Tailscale

Tailscale carries and encrypts the traffic between the phone and the Mac, on
the same Wi-Fi or across networks, and identifies each device. Stim adds no
cryptography of its own. You need Tailscale on the Mac and on the phone, in the
same tailnet or with the Mac shared to the phone's user.

`stim-server` listens only on `127.0.0.1` and on the Mac's Tailscale
addresses, never on every interface. It re-reads the Tailscale state in the
background, so a server that started before Tailscale was up, or while it did
not answer, starts listening on the Tailscale addresses once it runs, and stops
when it goes away. Run this once so clients can use
`wss://<mac>.<tailnet>.ts.net:7443` with a valid certificate:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --https=7443 http://127.0.0.1:7787
```

The dedicated port 7443 keeps the server tailnet only and leaves port 443 to
other apps. Do not serve `stim-server` on a port where Tailscale Funnel is on:
Funnel makes every handler on that port reachable from the public internet.

`stim-server` reads `tailscale serve status --json` at start and on every
`pair`. It uses the HTTPS port whose `/` handler proxies to its loopback port,
preferring 7443. Without such a route, it assumes 7443 and prints the command
above, or the next free port when 7443 is taken. It never suggests a Funnel
port. Any handler, at any path, or TCP forward that reaches the server on a
Funnel port makes it public, and `pair` refuses.

When Tailscale is not running, `stim-server` listens on loopback only and
says so on stderr. Start Tailscale, then restart `stim-server`.

## Pairing

`stim-server pair` prints the JSON that the pairing QR code encodes:

```json
{ "v": 1, "name": "Janic's MacBook Pro", "endpoint": "wss://janics-mbp.tail1234.ts.net:7443", "pairingToken": "..." }
```

The endpoint names the route's port, and omits it for 443. When a route to
the server is on a port with Funnel on, `pair` refuses and exits 1 without
creating a token.

The pairing token works once and expires after 5 minutes. A client spends it in
`hello` and receives a random device token, which it presents on every later
connection. The server stores only the SHA-256 hash of each token.

At pairing, the server records the peer's tailnet node and user from
`tailscale whois`. A device token presented from any other node is refused, so
a leaked token alone is not enough. A device paired over loopback, from this
Mac, is accepted only over loopback. `tailscale serve` connects from loopback
and names the peer in `X-Forwarded-For`, which the server trusts only on
loopback connections. Forward only `tailscale serve` in HTTP mode to the
loopback port: a forwarder that omits that header, such as `tailscale serve
--tcp`, `ssh -L`, or a tunnel, makes every remote peer look like this Mac.

A connection must send `hello` within 5 seconds. Five failed attempts from the
same peer within a minute block new connections from it for up to a minute.

Paired devices live in `$STIM_HOME/server/devices.json`. Revoking a device
closes its open connections. The server checks registrations on file changes
and once a second, so a missed filesystem notification cannot leave a revoked
connection authorized.

## Scopes

A paired device has the `read` capability, which serves state, or also
`control`, which runs [actions](#actions) and [controls devices](#control). Pairing grants `read` only, unless
the pairing code came from `stim-server pair --control`. On the Mac,
`stim-server devices grant <id> --control` adds control to a paired device and
`--read` takes it away. Nothing a client sends changes its own capabilities.
The server checks the device's capabilities in `devices.json` on every action
and control session, and ends a device's control sessions when it loses
`control`, so taking control away applies to open connections on the next
registration check. `hello` reports
the capabilities and actions of the connection's device when it connects; a
connection sees a new grant after it reconnects.

Every method other than `hello` needs `read`. A device with only `build`
gets `forbidden` for all of them.

## Build access

`build` lets another Mac on the tailnet run its project's code on this Mac to
build for it: config plugins, CocoaPods hooks, Xcode script phases and Gradle
plugins run as the user `stim-server` runs as. It never comes with `read` or
`control`, and `devices grant` never turns a paired device into a build
client. Grant it only to Macs you trust with that. A connection from this Mac,
over loopback, cannot get it: it has no tailnet node to bind the token to.
Because the server trusts `X-Forwarded-For` on loopback (see
[Pairing](#pairing)), a process on this Mac can still claim a tailnet peer's
address. Run `stim-server` as a user no one else can run processes as when
other people use this Mac, and approve a request only when you expect it.

A Mac gets `build` only by asking and being approved on this Mac. The client
sends `hello` with `auth` set to `{ "request": "build", "deviceName" }`, a
name of at most 64 UTF-16 code units with no control or format characters.
The server records a pending build client bound to the peer's node, answers
with a `deviceToken`, no capabilities and
`approval: { "state": "pending", "expiresAt" }`, and closes the connection.
`stim-server devices` lists it as `pending build`. On this Mac,
`stim-server devices grant <id> --build` approves it and
`stim-server devices revoke <id>` denies it; Stim Desktop's **Allow** and
**Deny** run those commands. Until then, `hello` with its token
fails with `approval-pending`, which does not count as a failed attempt, while
the request itself does, so a peer cannot send more requests than failed
attempts. A request lapses after 15 minutes. Each node has at most one pending
request, the newest, and the server holds at most 8; more fail with
`limit-exceeded`. There is no pairing code for `build`: `stim-server pair`
never grants it.

`devices grant` never gives `build` to a paired device, or `read` or
`control` to a build client. Build clients live in
`$STIM_HOME/server/build-clients.json`, apart from `devices.json`, so a
`stim-server` release without `build` never reads them and refuses their
tokens.

## Device-host approval

Device hosting has a separate `device-host` capability. An approved client can
reserve, boot, reconnect to and stop its own iOS simulator through the protocol.
It can deliver, install and launch a compatible app bundle, stream the simulator
and control it. The hosted app connects back to Metro on the client Mac.
Automatic CLI placement, client view/control relays and Android hosting remain in [#2266](https://github.com/appandflow/stim/issues/2266).

A client on the tailnet sends `hello` with
`auth: { "request": "device-host", "deviceName": "Laptop" }`. As with a build
request, the server returns a token and pending approval, then closes the
connection. It binds the token to the peer's tailnet node. Requests expire
after 15 minutes; each node keeps only its newest pending request of this kind,
and at most eight device-host requests can be pending. Build requests have a
separate limit. The same name validation and failed-attempt limit apply.

On the hosting Mac, inspect `stim-server devices`, then approve the matching
request with `stim-server devices grant <id> --device-host`, or use **Allow**
in Stim Desktop. Approve only an expected request: it authorizes that Mac to
reserve session-owned iOS simulators and run its native app code in them. **Deny**
or `stim-server devices revoke <id>` removes it; revocation also closes its
open authenticated connections. The local-process trust boundary described in
[Build access](#build-access) applies here too.

Hosting clients live in `$STIM_HOME/server/device-host-clients.json`, separate
from phone pairings and build clients. A hosting token grants no `read`,
`control` or `build` access, including access to unrelated workspaces. Existing
read, control and build tokens cannot gain hosting through `devices grant`.
Loopback requests and `pair --device-host` are refused.

### Hosted iOS session protocol

An approved client sends `device-host.reserve` with an opaque attempt ID and
its workspace/slot identity:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "method": "device-host.reserve",
  "params": {
    "workspace": "/client/app",
    "slot": "default",
    "platform": "ios",
    "attempt": "run-1",
    "deviceType": "iPhone 17 Pro",
    "runtime": "27.0"
  }
}
```

Omit `deviceType` and `runtime` to use the worker's installed defaults. The
response names an opaque session and its `preparing`, `ready`, `stopping`,
`stopped` or `unknown` state. Native work runs in a separate bounded child, so
the connection remains available. Poll `device-host.attach` with
`{"session":"<id>"}` or `{"attempt":"run-1"}`; a ready session includes the
exact simulator, runtime and architecture selected on the worker.

After a lost reply or connection, replay the same reserve request or attach to
its attempt. That resolves the same session; a changed request with that attempt
is refused. Another attempt cannot replace an occupied workspace/slot. The
client never supplies a worker filesystem path or another client's session.
`device-host.stop` with `{"session":"<id>"}` shuts down only its recorded,
ledger-owned simulator. Poll attach for completion. A new attempt may reserve
after the previous one is confirmed stopped. Stopped device records remain for
ownership and reconciliation; stop does not delete the simulator.

The worker persists the journal under `$STIM_HOME/server/device-host-sessions/`
and chooses an isolated worker home under `$STIM_HOME/device-host/sessions/`.
An uncertain create, child exit, journal or shutdown outcome retains the slot
as `unknown`. Explicit stop can reconcile a complete record after a server
restart; a live or unverifiable owner is refused. Missing ownership records
need operator investigation, never a replacement inferred from a simulator name.
Revoking this client's approval stops its sessions without granting access to
the worker's other devices.

`concurrency.maxDevices` bounds hosted reservations atomically, including
unresolved sessions. Ordinary local producers do not join that reservation
transaction, so this is not a machine-wide hard capacity guarantee. Unknown
inventory or elevated/unknown memory pressure refuses native creation. This
protocol slice does not change `stim ios` placement.

### Hosted iOS app delivery

App offers, chunks and launches require a ready session held by this server.
After its owner disappears, session attach reports `unknown`; app operations
refuse until explicit stop reconciles the retained session. A ready journal
entry alone does not authorize another native operation.

Send `device-host.app.offer` with the ready session, a new opaque app `attempt`,
the expected `bundleId`, `mode: "development"|"release"`, and
`manifest: {"sha256":"<digest>","size":<bytes>}`. The manifest is a UTF-8 JSON
array of `{path, kind, size, sha256}` entries, where `kind` is `file`, `exec` or
`link`. Paths are relative to the `.app` root. A link's content is its relative
target; it must resolve inside the bundle. No entry may sit below a file or
link. Duplicate paths, including Unicode/case aliases, are refused.

An offer returns `{delivery, missing}`. Upload each missing digest with
`device-host.app.chunk` and `{session, attempt, sha256, offset, data}`; `data` is
base64 for at most 32 KiB of raw bytes. The reply names the next byte `offset`.
Replay of the same bytes is safe after a lost reply. Re-offer to learn received
offsets. Upload the manifest first, then re-offer for its missing file content.
The manifest is limited to 8 MiB and 20,000 entries, with at most 1 GiB per file,
1 KiB per link, and 4 GiB of declared bundle content. An app attempt cannot
change its identity, mode or manifest. Complete a receiving attempt or stop the
session before starting another transfer.

After every digest is verified, call `device-host.app.launch` with
`{session, attempt}`. Poll `device-host.app.attach` for `installed` or `unknown`.
Reconnect to the same app attempt to reconcile a lost launch reply; replay
does not install or launch twice. Session attach includes the latest
`appAttempt`. Development offers may include `devClientScheme` for an Expo
development client; the attempt cannot change that scheme. The worker verifies the plist identity and simulator metadata,
the executable's Mach-O platform, architecture and minimum OS, then rechecks
the exact private device ledger before install and launch.

Development launch reports `launched: "unverified"`: a bridge or native process
alone does not prove bundle delivery. Release launch reports `true` only after observing a live native app
process; absent evidence remains `"unverified"`. Stop and approval revocation
cancel an in-flight install before shutting down the owned simulator. Uncertain
native outcomes retain the session as `unknown`; explicitly stop it before
retrying. Receipts and artifacts remain in the server-chosen session area;
artifact retention and session reuse/retirement remain under
[#2266](https://github.com/appandflow/stim/issues/2266) and
[#2348](https://github.com/appandflow/stim/issues/2348).

### Private hosted Metro

The client keeps its verified workspace Metro on loopback. It creates a
`createMetroGateway` from `@stim-cli/core`, binds it only to its own Tailscale
address, and supplies the pinned worker's literal tailnet address, local Metro
port and a fresh 32-byte secret encoded as 64 lowercase hex characters. The
gateway accepts only that worker address and authenticates each connection
before forwarding to the fixed local Metro port. It never targets a client
supplied URL. Close the gateway when its session ends.

Call `device-host.metro.open` with `{session, gatewayPort, secret}` on the
approved hosted connection. The server connects only to that connection's
authenticated tailnet peer and returns `{port}` for the worker's loopback
endpoint. Development installation uses that port for `RCT_jsLocation` and,
when offered, the Expo development-client deep link. HTTP and WebSocket bytes
stream over WireGuard with socket backpressure; no public tunnel, Funnel or
Tailscale serve configuration change is needed. The 64 KiB server message
limit remains unchanged.

Replaying the same open request keeps the port. Client disconnection leaves
the bridge available for the same session while its server owner lives. Call
`device-host.metro.close` to replace a gateway, then reopen on the same port;
an occupied port refuses rather than sending the app to another listener.
Closing a bridge interrupts its active streams. Stop, revocation and server
shutdown close its sockets before device shutdown. After a server owner
disappears, the retained session requires explicit stop, as app delivery does.

Expo dev-launcher and CLI versions that send and honor the `Forwarded` header
resolve relative manifest URLs against the worker origin. Older versions may
embed the client's local port instead; this slice does not rewrite manifests
or claim that those versions work through a different worker port. Client
placement still needs to check that contract before selecting hosted Metro.
Bare React Native uses the worker `RCT_jsLocation`. Bridge readiness and
manifest requests are not launch proof; development remains `unverified` until
the workspace observes the app's own bundle delivery.
This is a protocol API for approved clients; automatic CLI placement,
client view/control relays and Android remain in [#2266](https://github.com/appandflow/stim/issues/2266).

### Hosted iOS view and input

An approved hosting client can subscribe to its ready session's exact owned
simulator without access to the worker's registered workspaces:

```json
{
  "id": 8,
  "method": "device-host.frames.subscribe",
  "params": { "session": "<hosted-session-id>", "fps": 5, "maxEdge": 1280 }
}
```

The result contains a subscription ID. JPEG delivery uses the existing `frame`
events; `video: ["h264"]` selects the existing H.264 binary stream and its
backpressure/keyframe rules. `device-host.frames.keyframe` and
`device-host.unsubscribe` take that subscription ID as `params.subscription`.
Hosted capture requires the compiled `stim-frames` helper and does not support
replay or screenshot fallback.

Start control with `device-host.control.begin` and
`{"session":"<hosted-session-id>"}`. Its result returns a connection-bound
control session ID and `lease: null`: the hosted lifetime claim protects this
private device. Only one controller can drive the device; `takeOver: true`
replaces the previous controller. Use the returned control ID with
`device-host.input.touch|text|button|rotate|posture`, using the same parameters
as ordinary input. Touch coordinates range from 0 to 1 on the streamed display.
End it with `device-host.control.end` and `{"session":"<control-id>"}`.

The worker derives the workspace, slot and UDID from its owned session; callers
cannot select arbitrary worker devices. Every begin and input rechecks session
ownership and current approval. Hosting approval grants neither ordinary
`frames.subscribe` nor ordinary `control.begin` access. Disconnecting releases
that connection's capture and input; reconnect to the same hosted session and
subscribe again.

Installation, stop, revocation and server close end capture and input before
native work reuses the session claim. In-flight native input settles before
teardown even after disconnect or takeover; a timeout waits for its child to
terminate. Known capture closes even if the journal
is unreadable or unwritable; unresolved native state and claims remain retained.
Hosted posture commands hold a separate child-aware input claim. A surviving
command or unresolved child identity blocks replacement ownership, install and
stop even after the server and capture helper exit; the refusal names the claim
and its manual cleanup command. An unknown or lost owner requires explicit stop
before replacement. This worker
protocol does not add CLI placement or a local viewer relay; those remain in
[#2266](https://github.com/appandflow/stim/issues/2266).

## Run as a service

`stim-server service install` runs stim-server as a per-user LaunchAgent on
macOS, so a build machine or a phone-serving Mac keeps it running without a
terminal:

```bash
stim-server service install [--port <n>] [--label <name>] [--serve]
                            [--env KEY=VALUE]... [--path-prepend <dir>]...
stim-server service status [--label <name>] [--json]
stim-server service uninstall [--label <name>]
```

`install` writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/<label>.plist` (label `dev.stim.server`
by default) and starts it with `launchctl bootstrap gui/<uid>`. The job runs the
absolute `node` and `stim-server.mjs` of the install that ran the command, on
`--port` (default 7787), with `RunAtLoad`, `KeepAlive` and a 30 second
`ThrottleInterval`, and logs to `~/Library/Logs/Stim/<label>.log`. When
`STIM_HOME` or `SHELL` is set in the installing shell, the job carries it. It
takes the `node` from PATH when that path resolves to the running binary, so a
Homebrew Node upgrade does not break the plist. Running `install` again
rewrites the plist and restarts the job; if the new job cannot start, it puts
the old plist and job back. `install` and `uninstall` act only on a plist
that `install` wrote, and refuse a port that another stim-server (Stim
Desktop's, for example) already answers on. Install from a permanent
installation, not from an `npx` cache, because the plist stores its paths. It never touches pairings, anything
under `$STIM_HOME/server` or settings. Start-up reads the login shell's
environment, which can take a minute, so `install` waits up to 15 seconds for
`/health` and otherwise tells you to run `status`.

The job runs in your GUI login session, so it starts when you log in and not at
boot. On a Mac with no one at the screen, turn on automatic login. Moving the
install, or changing its Node, needs `install` again.

`--serve` adds the tailnet-only route from [Tailscale](#tailscale) on the port
`stim-server` would suggest. It refuses when Funnel is on for a port that
reaches the server, and it never enables Funnel. When a route already reaches
the port, `install` records that it did not create it. `uninstall` removes a
route only when `install` created it and it still points at this port. Without
`--serve`, `install` prints the command to run. A route that exists only in a
foreground `tailscale serve` session counts as present. To move a service that
created a route to another `--port`, run `uninstall` first.

`--env KEY=VALUE` and `--path-prepend <dir>` pin variables and PATH entries for
the server. stim-server replaces its environment with the login shell's at
start, so a `PATH` or `GEM_HOME` in the plist alone is lost and an entry in
`~/.zshrc` changes the terminal too. These flags apply after that capture, to
the server and to the builds it starts, and the plist stores them as
`ProgramArguments`. `--path-prepend` puts directories in front of PATH in the
order given; `--env` cannot set `STIM_HOME`. The values sit in plain text in the plist and in the process arguments, so do not pass secrets. For a private CocoaPods:

```bash
stim-server service install --serve \
  --path-prepend /Volumes/SSD/gems/bin \
  --env GEM_HOME=/Volumes/SSD/gems --env GEM_PATH=/Volumes/SSD/gems \
  --env LANG=en_US.UTF-8 --env LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

`status` prints whether launchd loaded the job, its state, pid, run count and
last exit code (a server that exits at start, for example on a port in use,
restarts every 30 seconds), the `/health` answer, the serve route and whether
`install` created it, the log path, and the digest of the bundled Stim's build
next to the `stim` on PATH. Offload needs the same digest on the client, so a
mismatch there is not an offload match either. `--json` prints the same fields
as one object.

`uninstall` boots the job out, removes the plist and, when `install` created it,
the serve route. Logs and pairings stay. Use `--label` and `--port` to run a
second service beside the first, for example with another `STIM_HOME`.

To set up a build machine: install Stim and stim-server on the Mac, run
`stim-server service install --serve` (with the pins its toolchain needs), set
`offload.workerRoot` there, and on each client run
`stim settings set offload.machines '["<mac>"]'` and `stim doctor --fix`.
Approve the request on the build machine with
`stim-server devices grant <id> --build`.

## Offloaded builds

A client with `build` runs its iOS simulator builds and Android emulator
debug builds here with these methods.
They need `build`, not `read`; a device without `build` gets `forbidden`.
The server re-reads the build clients on every call, and revoking a client
closes its connections and cancels its builds.

- `build.offer` takes `repo` (the client's name for its repository: letters,
  digits, `.`, `_` and `-`, at most 80) and an optional `lockfile` sha256. It
  returns `toolchain` (`stimBuild`, a digest of the bundled Stim's built code;
  `arch`; `xcode`; `simulatorSdk`; `cocoapods`; `runtimes`, the simulator
  runtimes with an iPhone simulator to build for; `jdk`, the major version of
  the JDK in `JAVA_HOME` or the macOS default; and `androidSdk`, the `ndk`,
  `buildTools` and `platforms` directories of the SDK in `ANDROID_HOME` or
  `~/Library/Android/sdk`, null without one), `capacity` and `warm`
  (`checkout`, `dependencies` when the last install used that lockfile, and
  `build` once a build ran there) for that repository. `capacity` holds
  `running` and `max` offloaded builds, `diskFreeBytes` of the worker root's
  volume and `minDiskFreeBytes`, `cpus`, `loadPerCore` (the 5-minute load
  average per CPU), `builds` (this Mac's own Stim runs in prebuild, pods or
  compile that it did not offload, plus the offloaded builds it runs), `maxBuilds` (its
  `concurrency.maxBuilds`, 0 when unlimited), `maxLoadPerCore` (its
  `offload.maxLoadPerCore`, default 2), and `declined`: why it would refuse a
  build now, or null. It declines while it runs its limit of offloaded builds,
  while the worker root's volume has less than 10 GiB free, while `builds`
  reaches a non-zero `maxBuilds`, or while `loadPerCore` is at or above
  `maxLoadPerCore`. The toolchain is read at most once a minute; capacity on
  every offer.
- `build.sync` takes `repo`, `files` and `done`. `files` is one page of the
  manifest, each `{ "path", "kind": "file"|"exec"|"link", "size", "sha256" }`,
  a link's blob being its target. Pages accumulate until `done`; the next
  `build.sync` starts a new manifest. A path is relative, with no `.`, `..`,
  empty or `.git` component (in any case). The result's `missing` lists the digests of the
  page this Mac lacks. The client then sends each as binary frames: 32 bytes of
  the sha256, then the next bytes of that blob, one blob after another. A frame
  for a blob that was not asked for, one that overruns its size, or bytes that
  do not match the digest close the connection with 4400. Blobs are kept per
  client and shared by all its repositories.
- `build.start` takes `repo`, `project` (the app directory in the repository),
  `platform` (`ios` or `android`), `configuration`, `scheme`, `runtime` (a
  simulator runtime identifier, required for `ios`, null for `android`),
  `fingerprint`, `packageName`, `isExpo`, `optimizations`, `android` (for
  `android`: `variant`, `abi`, `gradleBuildCache`, `pch` and `compilerCache`,
  `ccache` or `none`) and `stimBuild`, after the whole manifest of `repo` was
  synced on this connection. It returns `{ "job" }`. It fails with
  `build-busy` while the offer would be declined, naming the reason, or while
  another build of the same client and repository runs, or while every one
  of this Mac's `concurrency.maxBuilds` slots is held, and with
  `build-refused` when `stimBuild` differs. The build runs `offload-worker.mjs` of the bundled Stim with
  `STIM_HOME` set to the repository's area. It makes the area's checkout
  hold exactly the manifest (a file git lists as untracked and not ignored,
  and not in the manifest, is deleted; ignored dependencies and generated
  projects stay), installs JavaScript dependencies when the lockfile changed,
  runs prebuild and `pod install` when needed, refuses unless the fingerprint
  equals `fingerprint`, and runs `xcodebuild` for one of this Mac's iPhone
  simulators on `runtime`, which it never boots, or Gradle's
  `assemble<variant>` for `abi` with ccache under the area's Stim home. A
  Gradle daemon leaves the build's process group, so no claim or slot tracks
  it. An Android build keeps the client's daemon warm, with Gradle's idle
  timeout set to `offload.gradleDaemonIdleMinutes` (default 30; 0 stops it
  when the build ends), and stops it when the build gets SIGTERM. Gradle
  fixes a daemon's idle timeout when the daemon starts, so a new value
  applies to the next daemon. Once no build of that client runs, stim-server
  sends SIGTERM to each daemon whose command line runs from the client's
  Gradle home when a build of the client was cancelled, when the client
  loses `build`, and, for every client, while this Mac has less than 2 GB of
  available memory (total memory minus Activity Monitor's Memory Used). It
  checks every minute and on each change under its server directory. A daemon
  whose Gradle home is deleted stops itself within seconds, because Gradle
  expires a daemon whose registry file is gone.
- `build.progress` events `{ "event": "build.progress", "job", ... }` carry a
  `phase` and `msg`, a build-log `record`, and last the `outcome`: `ok`, and
  on success `artifact` (`name`, `size`, `sha256` of a tar of the `.app` or
  `.apk`),
  `fingerprint`, `compilationCache` and `timings`, otherwise `code` and
  `message`.
- `build.cancel` takes `job` and stops it. Closing the connection with a
  close frame cancels its jobs too. The build's process group gets SIGTERM,
  then SIGKILL 5 seconds later. A connection that ends without a close frame
  (1006, for example when the network drops) leaves its jobs running for 5
  minutes; a job no connection takes back by then is cancelled, and so is one
  whose client is revoked meanwhile. A job whose `build.start` answer was lost
  with the connection is only reclaimed this way.
- `build.attach` takes the `job` of this client that another connection
  holds or held, such as one whose connection dropped or stalled, and moves it
  to this connection: its later `build.progress` events come here, and
  `build.cancel` and `build.artifact` take it. It answers `{ "outcome" }`,
  the job's outcome when it already ended, else null. Progress sent while no
  connection held the job is not replayed. A job that is gone, or belongs to
  another client, gets `bad-request`.
- `build.artifact` takes the `job` of a successful build and sends the archive
  as binary frames, each 32 bytes of its sha256 and then the next bytes, then
  answers `{ "name", "size", "sha256" }`, and deletes it here. An archive
  nobody fetched is deleted when its job is cancelled; one left by a server
  that crashed stays under `repos/<repo>/out/` until you delete it.

The worker root is `offload.workerRoot` in this Mac's Stim settings, or
`$STIM_HOME/build-worker`. Each client gets `<root>/<device id>/`, with its
blobs, caches (`CP_HOME_DIR`, `CP_CACHE_DIR`, the pnpm store and
`GRADLE_USER_HOME`) and one area
per repository under `repos/<repo>/`: the checkout, its own Stim home with
DerivedData, the compilation cache and ccache, and the output. A build never reads or
writes this Mac's own Stim home. An ownership claim at
`repos/<repo>.claims`, whose child is the build's process group, guards each
area; it is released only once that group is gone, and a claim whose server
and build are both gone is recovered by the next build. With a non-zero
`concurrency.maxBuilds`, the build also holds one of this Mac's build slots
(`$STIM_HOME/build-slots/`), the same claims local Stim builds take, with the
same child, so a local build waits for it and `builds` counts it. Each finished build
appends a `build` record to the [action log](#actions) with the repository as
`workspace`. The worker root keeps growing with each repository; delete a
client's directory to reclaim it.

## Protocol

JSON messages over a WebSocket. Requests are `{ "id", "method", "params" }`,
answered by `{ "id", "result" }` or `{ "id", "error": { "code", "message" } }`.
Events are `{ "event", "subscription", ... }`.

- `hello` must come first. Params: `protocol` (1), `client` (`name`,
  `version`), and `auth`, one of `{ "pairingToken", "deviceName" }`,
  `{ "deviceToken" }`, or `{ "request": "build", "deviceName" }` (see
  [Build access](#build-access)). The result carries the server name and versions, the
  device's `capabilities` (see [Scopes](#scopes)), the server's `features`
  (`physical-ios` and `physical-android` when it serves `physical: true` for
  that platform: see `frames.subscribe` below for an iPhone and
  [Physical Android devices](#physical-android-devices), and `notifications`
  for `notifications.list` and the `notification` event),
  the `actions` it may run
  (none without `control`), the paired device, and the new `deviceToken` when
  the hello paired. `server.home` is the home folder
  of the user the server runs as, so clients can show paths under it as
  `~/...`.
- `status.subscribe` returns a subscription id. Each `status` event carries a
  full payload as `stim status --watch --json` prints it, including each
  environment's `physicalDevices`, the phones it leases, and its `agents`, the
  Claude Code and Codex sessions working in it. Those carry the session id,
  working directory, the short session name the tool keeps, and times, never
  prompts or conversation. `openUrl` there is a `claude://` or `codex://` link
  that only the Mac can open; the server has no action that opens it. `webUrl`
  is a Claude Code session's `https://claude.ai/code/` link while Remote Control
  is connected, which a phone opens in the Claude app or a browser.
  `endedAgents` lists the sessions that stopped running there in the last 3
  days, with the same fields as last found, no `pid`, and `endedAt`. The server
  drops `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` and `CODEX_THREAD_ID` from the environment of
  the `stim` commands it runs, so a phone's reload is not recorded as the work
  of the agent session that started the server. All subscribers share
  one `stim status --watch --json` child, which stops with the last
  subscriber. While any status subscription is open, the server keeps a CPU
  and memory history from each payload's `machine.owners`, and every `status`
  event carries it beside the payload as `usage`, once it holds a reading:
  `{ "intervalMs", "endAt", "environments", "devices" }`. It covers the last 10
  minutes in 15-second slots, the cadence at which `status --watch` rereads
  machine usage, oldest first, at most 40 points: point `i` of `n`
  is at `endAt - (n - 1 - i) * intervalMs`, and a slot no payload fell in is
  `null`. Each `environments` entry is `{ "workspace", "cpuPercent",
"memoryMb" }` and sums every machine owner of that environment path; each
  `devices` entry is `{ "kind", "id", "workspace", "slot"?, "cpuPercent",
"memoryMb" }` for a simulator (`id` its UDID) or emulator (`id` its AVD name).
  `cpuPercent` is ps %CPU, where 100 is one core. The history lives in the
  server's memory only. While the server holds `stim device lock` leases for
  phones that control a device, every `status` event also carries their
  `grantedAt` times as `ownLeases`, so a client can tell a person controlling a
  device from an agent driving it: an `activity.driver` of `stim device lock`
  whose `since` is in `ownLeases` is a phone.
- `logs.query` returns `{ "records" }`, and `logs.subscribe` sends `logs`
  events: first the last `tail` matching records, then new ones in batches.
  Both take the Stim Desktop log viewer's filters: `workspace` (required),
  `sources` (`metro`, `client`, `device`, `build`, `agent`), `slot`, `level` (the
  minimum), `grep` (a regular expression), `errors`, and `tail` (1 to 5000,
  5000 by default). Without `sources`, `errors` keeps the CLI's default error
  scope. They run `stim logs --json` and `stim logs --json --follow` in the
  workspace. Subscribers with the same workspace and filters share one
  `--follow` child, which stops with the last of them.
- `stats.get` returns the same payload as `stim stats --json`, using the shared
  core reader in a bounded, cancellable server child. The stats part of
  `machine.details` uses the same reader. `settings.get` runs
  `stim settings --json`, which masks sensitive values. Without `workspace`,
  these reads use the home directory as their project context.
- `frames.subscribe` takes `workspace`, `platform` (`ios`, `android` or `web`),
  `slot` (`default` when absent), `fps` (1 to 30, 5 by default) and `maxEdge`
  (240 to 2048 pixels, 1280 by default), and sends `frame` events: a JPEG,
  base64 in `data`, with `width`, `height` and `capturedAt`, at most `fps` a
  second and only when the screen changed. It serves only a booted simulator
  or a running emulator that `stim status` lists as owned by that workspace,
  or with `web` the page of the workspace's running Stim-owned Chrome from
  `stim web` (default slot only), or with `physical: true` the physical
  iPhone (see below) or Android phone (see
  [Physical Android devices](#physical-android-devices)) the workspace leases
  in that slot;
  any other device ends the subscription with a `frames-failed` `error`
  event, and so does a device that stops or changes owner. A client whose
  socket has more than two frames unsent skips frames and gets the newest
  once it catches up.

  A server advertising `device-frames` accepts `deviceFrame: true` for live
  ordinary iOS simulators and Android emulators. The existing read permission
  and registered-workspace/owned-device checks apply. `device-frame` events
  carry `artwork` (or null): PNG `background` and `foreground` layers, outer
  `width` and `height`, screen `aperture` (`x`, `y`, `width`, `height`),
  `cornerRadius`, and clockwise `quarterTurns`. Pixels come from installed
  DeviceKit or Android skins at runtime; no artwork is bundled and no local
  file paths are exposed. Layers are sent only to opt-in subscriptions and
  cleared on replay or device changes. The screen bytes stay unchanged.
  JPEG `artworkTurns` and live H.264 flag bit 5 with quarter-turns in bits 3-4
  bind housing to its capture, including same-size rotations. A client shows
  housing only when that rotation and aperture aspect match its screen.
  Missing, oversized or unsupported artwork falls back to the existing screen:
  Duo, Android foldables/circular displays, web and physical devices have no
  housing in this path. Artwork notices stay within the helper's 16 MiB message
  limit; the combined PNG layers are limited to 10 MiB before base64 encoding.

  A server advertising `duo-frames` also accepts `duoFrame: true` for a live local
  owned iPhone Duo. The helper composes the installed DeviceKit V68 model with
  both display surfaces and a current `devicectl` hinge-angle reading. It sends
  JPEG `frame` events with `duo: { revision, screenID, angle, orientation }` bound
  to the image. This path does not offer H.264 or replay; other live subscriptions
  and raw recordings keep their existing capture. Missing model or angle data
  falls back to the raw screen. The hinge reader runs only while composition is
  requested and stops on helper stdin EOF or parent exit.

  Clients acknowledge actual image display locally before accepting input and
  keep the image stable during a drag. `input.touch` takes the matching
  `duoRevision` instead of `display`; the helper raycasts against the original
  posed screen, refuses unknown revisions and ignores bezel or hinge touch-down.
  Move and up stay bound to that pose. Ending Control releases any held touch,
  even when read subscribers keep the helper alive.

  Frames come from the `stim-frames` helper. When it starts, the server
  compiles it with `xcrun swiftc` from the Swift sources shipped in
  `dist/stim-frames/` (its own `main.swift` and the frame and input code it
  shares with Stim Desktop), which takes a few seconds, and keeps it in
  `$STIM_HOME/server/helpers/`, named by a hash of the sources and the
  compiler version. For a simulator it renders the display's framebuffer
  (CoreSimulator's IOSurface) when the display reports damage, turned
  upright. An iPhone Duo lights one of its two panels, the cover while
  folded and the inner panel while unfolded, and leaves the other black, so
  the helper streams whichever panel is lit; its frames and video carry
  `posture`, and the size changes with the panel. For an emulator it keeps one gRPC `streamScreenshot` call open,
  found through the discovery file and token the emulator writes when Stim
  boots it. It scales frames to fit the largest `maxEdge` and paces them to
  the highest `fps` its subscribers asked for. All subscribers of a device
  share one helper, which sends a new subscriber the latest frame. It keeps
  running for 10 seconds after the last subscriber leaves, so a client that
  subscribes for one frame at a time reuses it and gets the latest frame at
  once, and exits after that or when the server's end of its stdin closes.

  A client that decodes H.264 adds `video: ["h264"]`. When the helper is
  built, the result carries `video: "h264"`, `fps` may go up to 60, and
  frames arrive as binary WebSocket messages instead of `frame` events: a
  big-endian header (u8 version 1, u8 flags with bit 0 set on a keyframe,
  and on an iPhone Duo bit 1 while folded or bit 2 while unfolded,
  u16 header length, u32 sequence number of the messages sent on this
  subscription, f64 capture time in milliseconds since the epoch on the
  Mac's clock, u16 width, u16 height, u8 subscription id length and the
  ASCII id), then one Annex-B access unit. Every keyframe carries its SPS
  and PPS, and the stream has no B-frames, so each access unit is shown as
  it arrives. A change of size, such as a rotation or a Duo fold, restarts
  the encoder, and the next access unit is a keyframe with the new SPS and
  PPS. The helper encodes with VideoToolbox in real time: Main
  profile, a keyframe at least every 2 seconds, straight from the
  simulator's IOSurface, from the emulator's RGBA frames, or from the page's
  screencast JPEGs, only when the screen changed. A subscriber starts at a keyframe, and `frames.keyframe`
  with its `subscription` asks for another one, such as after its decoder
  lost state; a device sends at most one requested keyframe every 250 ms.
  A subscriber whose socket holds more than 256 KB unsent drops frames
  until it drains, then gets a keyframe. While it is behind, the device's
  bitrate halves every 2 seconds, from 3 Mbps down to 0.25 Mbps; it climbs
  back by a quarter every 2 seconds without congestion, up to 8 Mbps. All
  video subscribers of a device share one encoder and its bitrate, and JPEG
  subscribers of the same device still get at most the `fps` they asked
  for. Watching video needs only `read`. Without the helper, the result has
  no `video`, `fps` above 30 is lowered to 30, and `frame` events arrive as
  before; a helper that fails before its first frame also falls back to
  `frame` events within a video subscription.

  Without the helper (the compiler is missing or fails, which the server
  retries every 5 minutes, or the helper fails before its first frame), and
  for a subscription made while it is still being built, frames come from
  screenshots, and `fps` and `maxEdge` only cap the rate. Simulators are
  captured with `xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot`, of the primary display,
  or of the default display when that `simctl` does not accept `primary`. An
  iPhone Duo lights one of two panels: the capture follows the lit one
  (`primary`, the cover, or `primary-1`, the inner panel) and the frame
  carries `posture`, `folded` or `unfolded`. Emulators are captured through
  their gRPC `getScreenshot`, scaled to fit 1280 pixels and converted with
  `sips`. An emulator whose gRPC POSTURE physical model reports a
  posture, such as a `pixel_fold` AVD, is a foldable: its frames carry
  `posture`, `folded` while the screenshot reports a folded display and
  `unfolded` otherwise. The server asks once per capture session, and a
  failed query counts as no hinge until the session restarts. A screenshot is sent only when the screen changed: up to 5 per
  second while it changes, backing off to one capture per second while it
  does not, with capturing taking at most half of each device's time, and at
  most two captures run at once. An emulator Stim booted before it passed
  `-grpc` has no endpoint on either path. A web page is captured with
  `Page.captureScreenshot`.

  A web page's frames and input go through the owned Chrome's DevTools
  endpoint, `web.cdpEndpoint` in `stim status`. Both the helper and the
  screenshot path connect only when `SystemInfo.getProcessInfo` names the
  Chrome pid status reports, then attach to the page's `targetId`. The
  helper runs `Page.startScreencast` sized to `maxEdge` and acks every
  frame; JPEG subscribers get Chrome's JPEG as is, and video decodes it for
  the encoder. Chrome draws a frame only when the page changes, so a
  keyframe request re-encodes the last one.

  With `physical: true` and `platform: "ios"`, frames come from the
  physical iPhone whose unexpired lease `stim status` lists under
  `deviceLeases` for the workspace and slot. `stim ios --device` holds that
  lease only while it runs, so `stim device lock ios <udid>` keeps the
  iPhone watchable between runs. A lease on the workspace's own simulator
  is skipped. The iPhone must be cabled over USB and trust the Mac; over
  Wi-Fi it has no screen to capture. The helper, run as
  `stim-frames iphone <udid> <name>` with the lease's device name, sets
  CoreMediaIO's `kCMIOHardwarePropertyAllowScreenCaptureDevices`, which
  makes macOS list cabled iPhones as capture devices, the ones QuickTime
  Player's New Movie Recording shows. Such a device's unique ID is a
  random UUID that names neither the UDID nor the USB device, so the
  helper first checks that an iOS device on USB has the UDID, without
  dashes, as its serial number. It then opens the iOS capture device
  named like the lease's device name, or the only one when the lease
  records no name and one iPhone is cabled. With several iPhones cabled,
  it waits until each shows a screen and refuses when none or several
  carry the name. It
  captures only while a subscriber asks for frames. macOS lets several
  processes capture the iPhone at once. Frames and video go through the
  same JPEG and H.264 paths as a simulator. A physical iPhone has no
  screenshot fallback: a subscription without the helper, or whose helper
  fails, ends with `frames-failed`, such as when the iPhone is not cabled
  or is unplugged. While macOS is asking for Camera access, or frames
  stop, such as while the iPhone is locked, the subscription gets
  `frame-delayed` with `delayed: true` and a `reason`, keeps its last
  frame, and gets `delayed: false` once frames can arrive again.

  macOS treats the iPhone's screen as a camera and attributes the helper's
  request to the app that started stim-server. Stim asks for it with its
  own Camera usage description and entitlement, so the first capture
  shows the Camera prompt for Stim. An app without them, such as `node`
  started from a shell, is denied without a prompt, and the subscription
  ends with a `frames-failed` that names the Camera pane of System
  Settings. A physical iPhone is view only: `control.begin` with
  `physical: true` refuses with `action-failed`. It is never recorded, so
  `at` and `frames.seek` on it fail with `no-recording`, and it counts
  toward no idle check.

- **Replay.** `replay.range` takes `workspace`, `platform` and `slot`
  (`default` when absent), like `frames.subscribe`, and returns what can be
  replayed of that device slot's [recording](#recording):
  - `enabled`: the workspace's `recording.enabled`, as the last status showed
    it.
  - `recording`: true while the server records the device now.
  - `spans`: the recorded time ranges `{ start, end }`, in epoch milliseconds on
    the Mac's clock, oldest first. Segments less than 1.5 seconds apart form
    one span; the gaps between spans are time nothing was recorded, such as
    after `stim stop`.
  - `markers`: `{ at, kind, command?, label }` from the start of the first span
    on, oldest first: the newest 400 actions and 100 errors. They come from `stim logs --json` in the
    workspace. `action` markers are the agent's actions on that device, failed
    ones included, from agent-device's session log and the owned Chrome page's
    agent input, with their `command`, such as `press`, `fill`, `open` or
    `click`. An agent-device action is placed when the command started, since
    it logs it when it finished, after any `--settle` wait. `error` and
    `crash` markers are error and fatal records of the workspace. Metro,
    client and build errors name no device, so they appear on every device of
    the workspace. `label` is the record's first line.

  It needs only `read`. A device with no recording gets empty `spans` and
  `markers`, and runs no `stim` command.

  `replay.keyframe` takes the same `workspace`, `platform` and `slot`, and
  `at` (epoch milliseconds), and returns one still frame for a scrubber
  preview without touching any subscription. The recording is stored in
  segments of about 5 seconds that each start at a keyframe; the server picks
  the segment `frames.seek` would show `at` from (the first one that ends at
  or after `at`, or the newest one) and reads only its first record. The
  result has the segment's `start` and `end`, the keyframe's capture time
  `at`, `width`, `height`, `posture` on an iPhone Duo, and `data`, the
  base64 Annex-B H.264 access unit with its SPS and PPS, so a client decodes
  it on its own; the server decodes nothing. The frame is the segment's first,
  so it can be up to about 5 seconds before `at`. It needs only `read`. It
  fails with `no-recording` when the device has no footage or that segment's
  first record is not a whole keyframe yet, as while it is being written. A
  connection can have 8 of these reads in flight; more fail with
  `limit-exceeded`.

  A video subscription can replay the recording instead of the live screen.
  `frames.seek` takes the `subscription`, `at` (epoch milliseconds) and `rate`
  (0, 1 or 2). The server sends the access units from the keyframe at or
  before `at` through the frame at `at`, or the newest frame when `at` is past
  it, as binary video messages right away, then plays on at `rate` times real
  time; 0 stays paused. The result's `at`
  is the capture time of the frame shown. Playback skips time nothing was
  recorded, and at the newest recorded frame it sends a `replay-ended` event
  with `subscription` and `at` and stays paused there. `frames.live` returns
  the subscription to the live screen, starting at a keyframe, or fails with
  `frames-failed` when the device is not running. While a subscription
  replays, the server sends no live frames on it, and `frames.keyframe`
  resends the frame shown from its keyframe. A seek on a device with no
  recording fails with `no-recording` and leaves the subscription live, and a
  JPEG subscription cannot seek.

  `frames.subscribe` with `at`, and optionally `rate`, starts the subscription
  replaying, and needs `video: ["h264"]`. It needs no running device, so the
  footage of a stopped workspace can be replayed; it fails with
  `no-recording` when nothing was recorded, and sends `replay-ended` at once
  when that footage holds no frame to show. Clients that never send these
  messages see no change.

- `recording.set` takes `enabled` and runs
  `stim settings set recording.enabled <enabled> --scope machine --json` in
  the home directory. It needs `control`, is logged like an
  [action](#actions) with `action` `recording.set`, and returns `enabled` and
  `recordingsDeleted`, the workspaces whose recordings turning recording off
  deleted.
- `build.plan` takes `workspace`, `platform` (`ios` or `android`) and `slot`
  (`default` when absent), and returns the payload of
  `stim <platform> --plan --json` run in the workspace: the fingerprint, the
  cache result the next build would get (`local`, `remote` or `false`), the
  prebuild decision, `expectedMs` with its `basis`, and on a predicted cold
  build its `missReason`. It builds, boots and
  installs nothing and writes no Stim state; a remote cache check can
  download the artifact into a temporary directory, so it gets 150 seconds
  instead of 60. A plan predicting that the build would refuse is a result
  whose `refusal` holds the code, message and remedy. A plan that cannot be
  computed is a `stim-failed` error. One plan runs per workspace at a time,
  across all connections; later requests wait their turn, and the 150
  seconds start when the plan starts.
- `machine.get` returns cheap machine usage, read in the server process
  without running `stim`: `volumes`, one per volume that holds a Stim
  workspace, Stim home, or the simulators, with `mount`, `holds`, `freeBytes`
  (free space without purgeable space, which Stim's disk budget measures) and
  `totalBytes`; `memory` with `totalBytes`, `usedBytes` (the Mac's memory in
  use as Activity Monitor's "Memory Used" counts it: app memory, wired and
  compressed; null off macOS) and the macOS `pressure` level (`normal`,
  `warning`, `critical`, or null); `load` with the 1, 5 and 15
  minute load averages and `cpus`; and `sampledAt`.
- `machine.history` returns `{ "intervalMs", "samples" }`: machine usage
  sampled every 5 seconds while at least one client is connected, the last
  720 samples (an hour of connected time), kept in memory only. Each sample
  has `at` (epoch milliseconds), `cpu` (busy fraction since the previous
  sample), `memoryUsedBytes`, `memoryPressure` (0 normal, 1 warning, 2
  critical) and `diskFreeBytes` of the startup volume; a field is null when it
  cannot be read. `sinceMs` returns only the samples taken after it.
- `machine.details` returns `{ "gc", "stats", "measuredAt" }`: the payloads of
  `stim gc --json` and `stim stats --json`, both run in the home directory, so
  a phone can show what Stim Desktop's Machine page shows about disk: every
  simulator, AVD, iOS runtime and system image, shared caches, recordings,
  workspace build outputs and logs, and what `stim gc --delete` would free. The
  `gc` run is always the dry run with no other flag; the server never deletes
  anything for this request. A part is null when its command failed, and
  `gcError` or `statsError` says why. It needs only `read`. The server keeps
  one result for 60 seconds, shared by every connection: a request while the
  commands run waits for them, and `measuredAt` says when they started. The
  commands fail after 150 seconds. Servers that predate it answer
  `unknown-method`. It also carries `buildMachines`, the `buildMachines` list
  of `stim doctor --json --platform ios` (never with `--fix`), so a phone can
  show whether each build machine takes builds. The server runs doctor only
  when `offload.machines` names a machine, else the list is empty; it runs it
  in the registered workspace that ran doctor for iOS most recently, because
  doctor judges a machine against an app. Like a doctor run from a terminal,
  that records the run for the workspace. `buildMachines` is null with
  `buildMachinesError` when doctor failed, the config could not be read, or no
  registered workspace exists. The reply never waits for doctor, whose offer
  to an unreachable machine can take about 13 seconds: it carries the last
  settled `buildMachines`/`buildMachinesError` (with `buildMachinesAt`, when
  they settled) while doctor refreshes them in the background, at most one run
  at a time, and sets `buildMachinesPending` while that background run has not
  settled a result yet, or the settled one is 60 seconds old or older. A client
  that wants the refreshed result asks `machine.details` again. It also
  carries `buildClients`, the builds this Mac ran as a build machine, one entry
  per client Mac read from the `build` records of the audit log, with `id`,
  `name`, `builds`, `failed`, `buildMs`, `lastAt` and the same three counts
  for `today`, most recent client first, with `today` on this Mac's local
  calendar day. Servers that predate it leave it out.
- `unsubscribe` ends a subscription.
- `push.register` takes `token`, an Expo push token, `events`, one or more
  [push notifications](#push-notifications) the phone wants (`started`,
  `stuck`, `looping`, `finished`, `machine`, `control`, `attention`), `ref`, an opaque
  string of up to 128 characters that every push carries back as `data.ref`,
  and optionally `stuckMinutes` (1 to 240, default 15), `quietHours`
  (`{ "start", "end", "timeZone" }`, minutes after midnight in an IANA time
  zone) and `levels`, each event's [delivery level](#delivery-levels) (for
  example `{ "stuck": "silent", "machine": "alert" }`). It needs only `read`. Registering again replaces the device's
  registration; `push.unregister` removes it. Phones from before these events
  may still send `build-failed`, `log-errors`, `disk`, `app-stopped`,
  `slow-build` and `agentOnly`: `disk` counts as `machine`, and the rest are
  accepted and ignored.
- `notifications.list` returns the [notification history](#notification-history)
  as `{ "log", "cursor", "notifications" }`, newest first. `since` (a `cursor`
  from an earlier list) returns only the entries after it. From then on, the
  connection gets a `notification` event, `{ "event": "notification", "log",
"notification" }`, for each entry the server logs. It needs only `read`.
- `action` runs an [action](#actions) and returns
  `{ "action", "workspace", "output" }`.
- An `error` event ends a subscription whose source failed, or whose client
  fell behind (`slow-client`); subscribe again.

`workspace` is an environment `path` from a status payload. Any other path is
refused with `unknown-workspace` and runs nothing. A connection holds at most
32 subscriptions and runs at most 4 `logs.query`, `stats.get`,
`settings.get` and `build.plan` requests at a time. Those requests fail after
60 seconds, `build.plan` after 150, or at 32 MiB of output, and closing the
connection stops them. When the command refuses with Stim's error contract on
stdout, the `stim-failed` message is its code, message and remedy; otherwise
it is the exit status and the end of stderr. A `stim` child that
ignores SIGTERM gets SIGKILL a second later. A log subscriber whose socket has more than
4 MiB unsent gets no more batches until it catches up; past 20,000
waiting records the server ends that subscription with `slow-client`.

## Recording

The server records owned simulators, emulators and the Stim-owned Chrome page
so clients can replay what happened while nobody watched. It records a device
while `stim status` shows an automation tool driving it (`activity.state` is
`driven`), or while a client has a `frames.subscribe` subscription to it. It
records nothing else, holds no device awake and changes no device setting. To
see drivers, the server keeps one `stim status --watch --json` child running
for as long as it runs, shared with status subscribers.

Recording goes through the device's `stim-frames` helper, shared with live
subscribers. The helper runs a second H.264 encoder for it, at 720 pixels on
the long edge, 1 Mbps and at most 10 frames a second, so live video keeps its
own bitrate. Live frames are captured at no less than 720 pixels and 10 frames
a second while the device is recorded. A device on screenshots, without the
helper, is not recorded, and a helper that fails is started again after 5
seconds, doubling up to 5 minutes. One stim-server records and prunes a Stim
home at a time, under an exclusive ownership claim at
`$STIM_HOME/server/recorder`; a second one serves replays and records once the
claim frees.

Footage is stored under `$STIM_HOME/workspaces/<id>/recordings/<platform>-<slot>/`
as segments of about 5 seconds, each starting at a keyframe; the server asks
the helper for a keyframe once a segment is 5 seconds old, so a screen that
does not change still gets new segments, and a keyframe request also restarts
the recording stream at a keyframe. The segment being
written is `<start>.part`, and a closed segment is `<start>-<end>.seg`, in epoch
milliseconds. A segment is a sequence of records: a u32 big-endian length of
the rest, u8 flags (bit 0 keyframe, bit 1 folded, bit 2 unfolded, as in a video
packet), f64 capture time in milliseconds since the epoch, u16 width, u16
height, then one Annex-B access unit. The server creates a segment only while
the workspace directory has its `workspace.json`, so it never fills a directory
that `stim worktree remove` or `stim gc` emptied.

Every 30 seconds it keeps the last 15 minutes of footage of each device,
counting only recorded time, and at most 1 GiB of footage across every
workspace, deleting the oldest segments first. It closes, at their last write,
the `.part` segments of a server that stopped. When a status payload shows
`recording.enabled` false for a workspace (the `recording.enabled` setting, or
`STIM_RECORDING` in the server's environment), it stops recording that
workspace within seconds and deletes its recordings. `stim stop` ends recording
and keeps the footage; `stim worktree remove` and `stim gc` delete it. A gc that
deletes the segment being written loses the rest of that segment; the next one
is written as usual. Recordings stay on the Mac and are served only to paired
clients.

## Push notifications

A paired phone that sends `push.register` gets notifications while its app is
in the background or closed. The server keeps the registration with the
pairing in `devices.json`, so revoking the device drops it. A token belongs to
one pairing: registering it from a new pairing of the same phone removes it
from the old one.

A notification means that your attention changes the outcome, or that work you
wait on started or finished. A failed build, new log errors, a stopped app or a
slow build on their own are normal agent iteration and do not push; the phone
shows them in its attention strip. The server pushes, per device and only for
the events the device chose:

- `started`: a workspace began warming (`phase` `warming`), or an agent first
  drove one of its devices. It is grouped per Mac, and opens the workspace, or the device viewer
  once an agent drives it. An agent driving the workspace updates the warming
  notification in place.
- `stuck`: an agent drove the workspace, its devices are still up, and nothing
  happened for `stuckMinutes`: no agent action, build, Stim run, Metro bundle
  request or new log error. App log records do not count, because an idle app keeps
  logging: an idle Stim app writes about 200 UIKit info records a minute. The
  owned Chrome page counts as a device: an attached tool's input there is an
  agent action, and while an agent drives it its page log also counts, since an
  agent's navigations and scripts are not agent actions. It opens the device viewer.
- `looping`: the newest three or more iOS or Android builds failed the same
  way, at the same first compiler diagnostic `file:line`, or with the same
  error code when there is none, such as three failed launches
  (`STIM_LAUNCH_FAILED`, which includes an app that exits at launch). It says,
  for example, `Same Swift error 3x at AppDelegate.swift:71` and opens the
  build details.
- `finished`: the agent stopped driving after a green build and nothing
  happened for 5 minutes, or stopped the workspace after a green build; the
  workspace's pull
  request became ready for review, or merged, which opens the pull request; or,
  when GitHub cannot be asked, git finds the branch merged into the default
  branch.
- `machine`: a volume holding Stim state has less than 5 GB free (the episode
  ends once 6 GB are free again), or memory pressure stayed critical for a
  minute. It opens the machine sheet.
- `control`: another client took over a device this phone controls, or an
  agent started driving it. It opens the device viewer.
- `attention`: something only a person can fix, from the needs-attention rule
  (`needsAttention` in `@stim-cli/core/oversight`): a port held by another app, a
  supervisor or owned Chrome Stim cannot verify, an owned AVD it could not
  check, a failed run with a signing or provisioning error code, a physical
  device lease that expired, or an EAS session running for 30 minutes with no
  agent driving the workspace. It opens the workspace, or the build for a
  signing failure. A stuck agent, a loop and a full disk notify through their
  own categories.

Stuck and finished are read from device activity, so two cases blur them. An
agent that finishes without closing its agent-device session still holds the
device, so it gets `stuck`, whose text then names the green build it stopped
after. With a `stim` whose status has no `activity.recent`, every app log
record counts as activity, so an app that keeps logging never looks stuck or
finished.

Each workspace notifies once per episode: a stuck agent notifies again only
after new activity and a new quiet stretch, a loop only after a success or a
different failure. A push carries a collapse id for its workspace and
category, so a later one replaces the earlier notification on the phone
instead of stacking. What is already true when the server starts or a device
registers does not push. During the phone's quiet hours nothing pushes: a
problem that still holds when they end pushes then, and what started or
finished during them does not.

While at least one device is paired, the server keeps its own
`stim status --watch --json` child running, even with no client connected, and
reads the free space of Stim's volumes and the memory pressure every minute.
While a device wants `finished`, it looks up the pull requests of worktree
branches that have an upstream every 5 minutes, with one `gh api graphql` call
per repository, the lookup `stim gc` uses. Without `gh`, or when it is signed
out or does not answer, that round relies on git, and the next round asks
again.

A device gets at most 20 alerting pushes an hour; silent pushes do not
count. More than three at once become one summary push that opens the
phone's home screen.

Pushes go to the Expo push service, `https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send`,
which forwards them to Apple. No APNs key or other secret lives on the Mac. A
workspace push carries the workspace title, a one-line cause and the Mac's name
as the subtitle; a machine or summary push has the Mac's name as its title. In
`data` it carries the `ref`, the screen to open (`home`, `machine`,
`workspace`, `device`, `build` or `url`), and the workspace's absolute path,
with the platform and slot for a device, the platform for build details and
the pull request's URL for `url`. The phone needs the path to open a workspace
before it has reconnected. It carries no logs. The server checks the push
receipts 15 minutes later and drops a token that Expo reports as
`DeviceNotRegistered`, and prints any other refusal, such as missing APNs
credentials, on stderr. Pushes are not retried, and nothing is pushed while
the server is not running.

### Delivery levels

Each event the device registers is delivered at one of two levels; an event it
leaves out of `events` is off and never pushes.

- `alert`: a banner and sound. The push has `sound: "default"`,
  `interruptionLevel: "active"` and `channelId: "attention"`, the phone's
  high-importance Android channel.
- `silent`: no banner or sound, only the notification list.
  The push has no sound, `interruptionLevel: "passive"` and
  `channelId: "updates"`, the phone's low-importance Android channel.

`levels` in `push.register` sets each event's level. An event it leaves out,
and every event of a phone that sends no `levels`, is silent. A summary push is
silent only when every notification it sums up is. An older server ignores
`levels` and alerts for every event but `started`.

The server and phone import the same pure rules from `@stim-cli/core/oversight`.
The phone formats home attention messages locally from the facts the shared rule selects.
`__tests__/oversight-agreement.test.ts` checks their categories, workspace names
and needs-attention vectors. Notification delivery remains local to each.

## Notification history

The server logs the notifications the rules produce for the Mac, whether or not
a phone was pushed, so a phone can list what it missed. While any device is
paired, it runs the rules once more for the Mac itself, with every category, no
quiet hours and the lowest `stuckMinutes` a registered device asked for (15
without one). Each notification it produces is an entry; a `control` conflict is
an entry too, listed only to the phone that lost the device. Pull request
entries need the GitHub lookup, which runs only while a device wants
`finished`.

An entry is `{ "seq", "at", "id", "category", "title", "body", "quiet",
"target", "suppressed"? }`. `seq` grows by one per entry. `id` names the
workspace or machine and category, the key a push's collapse id is made from,
so a later episode of the same problem shares it. `target` is the screen the
push opens, as `{ "kind", ... }` with the fields of the push's `data`.
`quiet` is the event's default delivery, always silent; a device's
[levels](#delivery-levels) decide how its push was actually delivered.
`suppressed` says why no registered device got the notification when it was
logged: `muted` when none wants its category, `quiet-hours` when those that do
were in quiet hours. A problem that still holds when quiet hours end is pushed
then, so a `quiet-hours` entry may still have reached the phone. Without
`suppressed`, a registered device was due to get it, or none is registered; a
device's hourly budget or a summary push can still stand in for the push
itself. A push for a logged notification carries the entry's `seq` as `data.notification`, so the
phone can mark it read.

The log keeps the last 200 entries, none older than 7 days, in
`$STIM_HOME/server/notifications.json`, which only the server writes, under
`notifications.json.lock`. `log` in `notifications.list` is a random id made
with the file: a new one means the history started over, so a cursor or read
state kept for the old one no longer applies. What is already true when the
server starts is not logged, as it is not pushed.

## Actions

A device with `control` can send `action` with params `{ "action", "workspace" }`:

| Action   | Params                                                               | Runs in the workspace           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `reload` | `platform` (`ios` or `android`), optional; needed when both are live | `stim reload [platform] --json` |
| `stop`   | none                                                                 | `stim stop --json`              |

Each action is one fixed argument list passed to the bundled `stim`, never
through a shell. `workspace` must be a project path Stim has registered, the
`path` a status payload lists; the command runs there. The result's `output`
is the JSON the command printed. The server refuses the request and runs
nothing with:

- `forbidden` when the device has only `read`;
- `unknown-action` for any other action;
- `bad-request` for a missing `workspace`, a `platform` that is not `ios` or
  `android`, or any other param;
- `unknown-workspace` for a path Stim has not registered or that no longer
  exists;
- `action-busy` while another action runs in that workspace. The server runs
  one action per workspace at a time, across all connections.

A command that exits with an error fails with `action-failed` and the message
and remedy it printed. An action fails with `action-failed` after 120 seconds,
and its `stim` child gets SIGTERM. An action keeps running when its client
disconnects, and stopping `stim-server` stops it.

Every `action` request from a paired device, refused or run, appends one line
to `$STIM_HOME/server/actions.ndjson`: `at`, `device` (`id` and `name`),
`action`, `workspace`, `platform` when given, `ok`, `error` when it failed,
and `durationMs` when it ran. Strings from the client and error messages are
cut to 256 characters. `stim-server log` prints them, with control characters
replaced by `?`.

## Control

A device with `control` can drive a simulator or emulator that `stim status`
lists as owned by a workspace, or a physical Android phone the workspace
leases (see [Physical Android devices](#physical-android-devices)). Nothing it
sends reaches any other device.

- `control.begin` takes `workspace`, `platform`, `slot` (`default` when
  absent), `physical` and `takeOver`, and returns `{ "session", "platform", "lease",
"postures" }`. `postures` lists what `input.posture` takes for the device:
  `folded` and `unfolded` for an iPhone Duo, `folded`, `half-open` and
  `unfolded` for an emulator with a hinge, such as a `pixel_fold` AVD, and
  none otherwise.
  The server refuses with `device-busy` when status reports the device driven
  (agent-device, a `stim device lock`, a test runner) or another client
  controls it, naming the driver. With `takeOver: true` it proceeds anyway;
  another client's session then ends with `taken-over`.
- The session holds a `stim device lock <platform> <id> --for 2m` lease,
  renewed every minute, so `stim status` shows the device as driven by
  `stim device lock` and agents leave it alone. `lease` carries its
  `grantedAt`, the `since` of that driver, so a client can tell its own lease
  from an agent's. The server releases the lease with `stim device unlock`
  when the session ends, unless the lease was already held before the session
  began, as when it took the device over from an agent in the same workspace;
  it renews only a lease it took. Leases belong to the workspace, not to the
  session: an agent in the same workspace that runs `stim device lock` on the
  device during a session shares the lease, and the session's end releases
  it.
- `input.touch` takes `session`, `phase` (`down`, `move`, `up`), `x` and `y`
  as fractions of the upright screen, and `display` (0, the main display).
  Without `display`, a touch on an iPhone Duo goes to the panel its latest
  frame showed, and before any frame to the cover.
  `input.text` takes up to 256 printable ASCII characters, where `\n` presses
  Return, `\t` Tab and `\b` Delete. `input.button` takes `home` or `lock`,
  and on Android also `back` or `app-switch`. `input.rotate` takes
  `direction` (`left` or `right`) and turns the device a quarter turn. An
  iPhone Duo rotates through its Virtualization provider in folded, half-open
  and unfolded postures. Apps keep their supported orientations, and its home
  screen stays portrait, as on other iPhones.
  `input.posture` takes one of the session's `postures`. A web page takes
  only `back`, its history back, and refuses rotation and posture. Each answers `{}` once the input
  is handed to the device: when it goes through the helper, that is when the
  helper receives it, so a failure there shows only in the server's log. A connection may send 120 inputs a second and type 40
  characters a second, with a burst of 256, and rotate or change posture twice a
  second; more fail with `limit-exceeded`.
- On an owned iOS simulator, `control.begin` also reports optional `simulator`
  capabilities: `canShake` and `slowAnimations` (a boolean, or `null` when
  unavailable). `input.simulator` takes the session and `action: "shake"`,
  `action: "read"`, or `action: "slow-animations"` with an explicit boolean
  `enabled`. It returns the confirmed capabilities and state. Unavailable
  controls are refused. The native operation times out after 8 seconds and
  stops when its control session ends; only one option changes per simulator
  at a time. These controls use the same CoreSimulator guest notifications as
  Stim Desktop, without opening Device Hub.
- `control.end` ends a session. The server also ends it with a
  `control-ended` event `{ "session", "reason", "message" }` after 5 minutes
  without input (`idle`), when another client takes the device over
  (`taken-over`), when the device stops or changes owner (`device-gone`),
  when the paired device loses `control` (`forbidden`), or when input cannot
  reach the device (`failed`). Closing the connection ends its sessions.

Input goes through the device's `stim-frames` helper, the process that
streams its frames:

- Simulators take touches, keys and buttons through the simulator's
  CoreDevice HID service (`dtuhidd`), the one Xcode's Device Hub uses, so
  input keeps working while Device Hub or Siniulator shows the simulator.
  With an Xcode whose simulators have no such service, input goes through
  SimulatorKit's legacy HID client instead. The first input starts that service, as Device
  Hub does, and from then until the simulator reboots it ignores tools that
  still use SimulatorKit's legacy HID client. Text is typed key by key on a US
  layout. `lock` is the side button.
- A web page takes DevTools input on the page's `targetId`: touches as
  `Input.dispatchTouchEvent` (a drag scrolls, on a desktop page too), text as
  key events, `\n`, `\t` and `\b` as Enter, Tab and Backspace. A web
  session holds no lease, since `stim device lock` covers devices; a
  DevTools client other than Stim's attached to the browser (`web.activity`
  in status, such as Playwright MCP) makes `control.begin` answer
  `device-busy` unless it takes over.
- Emulators take touches through the emulator's gRPC `sendTouch`. Text and
  buttons go through gRPC `sendKey` when the emulator reports a hardware
  keyboard, which AVDs Stim creates have. An emulator without one drops key
  events, so for it text and buttons go through `adb -s <serial> shell input`.
- Rotation and posture go the way Stim Desktop sends them: a simulator turns
  through the orientation message Simulator.app sends it, and an emulator
  through gRPC `setPhysicalModel` for rotation and `setPosture` for its hinge.
  An iPhone Duo folds with `sim-fold`, which the server builds from Stim
  Desktop's sources on the first fold and runs inside the simulator with
  `xcrun simctl spawn`; it answers `{}` once the fold finished, and fails
  with `action-failed` when the fold does not finish within 40 seconds. `sim-fold`
  swaps the posture, so the server runs it only when the Duo's latest frame
  shows the other posture, and refuses the request until a frame showed one.

Every session start, takeover and end, and every refused `control.begin`,
appends a line to the action log, with `action` set to `control.begin`,
`control.take-over` or `control.end`, and a `reason` that says why the session
ended or whom it took the device from. Inputs are not logged.

The error codes `unauthorized`, `pairing-expired`, and `protocol-unsupported`
refuse the client until it pairs again or updates; `approval-pending` refuses
a build client until the Mac approves it; clients retry the others.

The package exports the message types, and the build writes their JSON Schema
to `dist/protocol.schema.json`, exported as `@stim-cli/server/protocol.schema.json`.

## Physical Android devices

A phone reached with `stim android --device <serial>` (or held with
`stim device lock android <serial>`) is used, not owned. With `physical: true`,
`frames.subscribe` and `control.begin` pick the phone the workspace holds an
unexpired lease on in `slot`, as `deviceLeases` in `stim status` reports it,
instead of the Stim-owned emulator. A workspace without that lease gets
`frames-failed` or `action-failed`, and so does a slot whose leased device is
an emulator. Watching needs `read`, as for an emulator. Control needs
`control` and that lease: the session never takes, renews or releases a
phone's lease, and `takeOver` cannot move one between workspaces. When the
lease is released or expires, the control session ends with `device-gone` and
frame subscriptions end with `frames-failed`. Both follow `stim status
--watch`: a release reaches the server when status next reports it, usually
within seconds and at most about 30 seconds plus one refresh. Input after an
expiry is refused at once. A physical Android device is not recorded, so `at`
and `frames.seek` answer `no-recording`, and a watched phone is not listed as
viewed for Stim's idle checks.

The `stim-frames` helper reaches the phone over adb only, with the scrcpy
server 4.1 (Apache-2.0), shipped in `dist/scrcpy/` with its `LICENSE` and a
`NOTICE`. Before every push, the helper checks the jar's sha256 against the one
pinned in its source. It then pushes the jar to
`/data/local/tmp/stim-scrcpy-<id>.jar`, starts it with `app_process` as the
shell user, and connects through an `adb forward` port. The server's cleanup
process deletes the jar as soon as it runs; when the helper stops, it removes
the forward and deletes the jar again. It installs nothing, and it asks
scrcpy for no settings change: no `show_touches`, no `stay_awake` and no
screen power change (`power_on=false`), with clipboard sync off. The phone
encodes H.264 of its screen as it is oriented, scaled to fit 2048 pixels;
the helper decodes it with VideoToolbox and feeds the same encoder, JPEG path,
keyframe requests and bitrate adaptation as a simulator or emulator. The
stream has no time limit and restarts only with the helper.

Input goes over scrcpy's control socket: touches as finger events in the
current frame's pixels, text as injected text, and `\n`, `\t`, `\b`,
`home`, `back`, `app-switch` and `lock` as key events. `input.rotate` and
`input.posture` fail with `bad-request`, because a phone turns only in hand.

Some Android 15 and 16 devices send no frame until their screen changes
(scrcpy #6500, #6546), so a tile can stay blank until then. With its screen
off, a phone streams what its display shows, such as a Samsung always-on
display, or black; the stream never wakes it.

For testing without a phone, `STIM_SERVER_TEST_ADB_EMULATORS=1` in the
server's environment lets a `physical: true` target resolve to an emulator the
workspace leases, which then streams and takes input over adb the same way.

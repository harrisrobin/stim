  The message names the hosting Mac and its reason: unreachable or changed
  tailnet node, no installed simulator choice, no capacity, elevated or unknown
  memory pressure, or an unresolved reservation or delivery. Stim boots nothing
  locally and never tries another Mac. Check stim-server and Tailscale there,
  then run stim doctor. Correct --device-type / --runtime when the offer names
  an unavailable choice. A session that exists stays recorded even if delivery
  fails: retry stim ios --remote <machine>, or run stim stop to reconcile it.
  An unreachable stop keeps the placement; rerun stim stop when the host answers.
  A failed build handoff uses upload instead. If native log queries are unavailable,
  logs prints a note on stderr and shows copied records. Update an older stim-server
  on the host to enable iOS handoff and native logs (hello feature hosted-ios-data).

  The same code refuses a native directory that the fingerprint leaves out of
  the cache key while git tracks its files, or when git cannot answer: Stim
  cannot show those files came from the current app config, and will not
  delete tracked files with \`expo prebuild --clean\`. Stop excluding the

    STIM_DEPS_FAILED: {
      summary: 'pod install or gradle sync failed; the bundler ladder and BUNDLE_FROZEN',
      body: () => `STIM_DEPS_FAILED
  \`pod install\` (iOS) or the gradle dependency sync (Android) failed. On iOS
  this runs only when Podfile.lock and Pods/Manifest.lock disagree, or Pods is
  absent -- which is exactly what a carried worktree produces.
  WHICH POD COMMAND: when the project root has a Gemfile and a Gemfile.lock
  that resolves cocoapods, pods go through bundler -- \`bundle check --dry-run\`,
  then \`bundle install\` only when that reports missing gems, then \`bundle exec
  pod install\` -- so the CocoaPods the lockfile pins is the one that writes
  Podfile.lock. Everything else gets plain \`pod install\`: no Gemfile, a Gemfile
  with no Gemfile.lock (\`bundle install\` would CREATE that tracked file in
  your checkout, which Stim will not do), and a Gemfile.lock that
  pins something other than pods, such as a fastlane-only bundle. When
  \`bundle\` is not on PATH the run prints one dim \`pods\` note and uses plain
  \`pod install\`. The \`pods\` phase line always names the command that ran, and
  the gem steps heartbeat under the \`gems\` label.
  Bundler runs with BUNDLE_FROZEN, so a Gemfile that no longer matches its
  Gemfile.lock FAILS the build rather than quietly falling back to unpinned
  pods -- silently using a different CocoaPods than the lockfile pins is the
  bug this path exists to kill. Run \`bundle install\` yourself and keep the
  result. Gems themselves are installed wherever BUNDLE_PATH points -- the
  project's own \`.bundle/config\` (vendor/bundle in the React Native template),
  or the environment. When that lands inside the project, Stim says so in a dim
  note naming which of the two set it; Gemfile.lock is never edited either way.
  \`worktree warm --refresh\` reports the same code for the install it runs in
  the SOURCE CHECKOUT -- the lockfile's own command (\`pnpm install\`,
  \`yarn install\`, \`bun install\`, \`npm ci\`) or that same pod ladder. The
  message names the command, quotes its last lines, and nothing is copied: fix
  the source checkout, then warm again.`,

    STIM_BUILD_FAILED: {
      summary:
        'xcodebuild or gradle failed; the Android missing-SDK and APK refusals; a damaged compilation-cache object',
      body: () => `STIM_BUILD_FAILED
  xcodebuild or gradle failed. The EXTRACTED diagnostics are printed (capped),
  not the transcript. Read the log path on the next line for the rest.
  Three Android refusals share this code without gradle itself failing:
  - NO ANDROID SDK, before gradle starts: nothing exists at the SDK path
    Stim resolves (ANDROID_HOME, else ANDROID_SDK_ROOT, else the default
    location), and there is no android/local.properties. Set ANDROID_HOME to the SDK or write sdk.dir
    into android/local.properties; \`stim doctor --platform android\` reports
    the same condition. When the SDK is found and neither variable is set,
    Stim passes its path to gradle as ANDROID_HOME.
  - MORE THAN ONE debug APK under android/app/build/outputs/apk and nothing
    configured to pick one (a project with product flavors, several flavors
    already built). Stim will not guess which flavor to install: the
    refusal lists the candidates -- pass \`--variant <name>\` or set the
    android.variant setting (e.g. "productionDebug") to the one you want.
    Flavors declared plainly in android/app/build.gradle are caught before
    the build instead (STIM_BAD_ARG); this one remains for the declarations
    that parse cannot read.
  - NO APK for the configured variant: the android.variant / --variant value
    does not name a real variant (\`./gradlew :app:tasks\` in android/ lists
    the assemble tasks).
  AN APK OLDER THAN THE BUILD IS NOT A REFUSAL. \`assembleDebug\` packages every
  flavor, so a later \`--variant previewDebug\` finds a current APK that gradle
  reports UP-TO-DATE and repackages nothing. Stim installs it. Gradle owns task
  freshness and the fingerprint owns cache freshness; Stim does not second-guess
  either from the file's mtime.

"failed to scan dependencies for source ..." on pods you did not touch  (ios)
  The compilation cache holds a damaged object. Xcode reports it per source
  file, so it names whichever targets reach the object first -- often pods such
  as sqlite3, nanopb or libwebp -- and the list changes between runs. The
  transcript carries the cause:
    error: CAS-based dependency scan failed: not a IncludeTreeRoot node kind
  A cache write that a full disk or a killed build cut short leaves such an
  object, and upgrading the CLI does not clear it. Empty that one cache with
  \`gc --delete --cache "compilation cache"\`, then build again. The next
  build is a cold one.`,
    },
    STIM_PATH_TOO_LONG: {
      summary: 'Windows only: the project root leaves no room for the NDK object paths ninja must open',
      body: () => `STIM_PATH_TOO_LONG  (android, Windows only)
  The NDK's ninja is not long-path aware, so every CMake object path has to
  stay under Windows' MAX_PATH. React Native's codegen objects are named
  after their mangled absolute source path, so each carries the project root
  twice unless CMake shortens it, and CMake only shortens a name that then
  fits the object path limit Stim's Gradle shim sets. The message names the
  longest known object (measured on the e2e fixture, for the ABI being
  built) and the longest root it leaves room for. Refused BEFORE Gradle runs
  -- a cache hit still installs -- because the build would otherwise fail
  deep inside ninja ("mkdir ... No such file or directory" or "Filename
  longer than 260 characters"). Map the project to a drive letter (\`subst
  X: <root>\`, then run Stim from X:\\) or move it under a shorter root.
  A custom Gradle buildStagingDirectory can be shorter than the default; this
  preflight does not inspect that configured path and may refuse it too.
  \`doctor --platform android\` reports the same root as a finding for the
  emulator's ABI.`,
    },
    fallbacks: {
      summary: 'release cache-hit notes that are not codes: swap failure, asset gate, uninstall, device fallbacks',
      body: () => `FALLBACK NOTES THAT ARE NOT CODES (release cache hits)
  On a release cache hit Stim regenerates this workspace's JS bundle into a
  COPY of the cached artifact before installing it -- \`ios --configuration
  Release\` into a copy of the .app, \`android --variant ...Release\` into a
  copy of the APK. An iOS app that sets React Native's RCTUseAssetCatalog
  Info.plist key also gets its RNAssets.bundle image catalog recompiled with
  actool from the new bundle. When any step of that swap fails (reading the
  app's Info.plist, the bundle command, hermesc, actool, the expo-updates
  manifest refresh, the re-sign, zipalign, apksigner), the run does NOT
  install the
  cached artifact -- its baked-in JS is the builder's, not yours -- and does
  NOT fail: it prints a \`swap        failed at <step>: ... --
  building fresh instead\` note on stderr and falls back to a full build. If
  the run then fails, the code is the build's own (STIM_BUILD_FAILED etc.);
  the swap note above it says why the cache hit was not used. A swap that
  merely finds no hermesc notes it and embeds the plain JS bundle instead --
  that is a note, not a fallback.

  ANDROID'S ASSET GATE is the second, and it is not a failure at all. Before
  re-packing, Stim compares this workspace's freshly emitted asset tree
  against the assets the cached APK carries. Any added, removed or changed
  asset prints

    swap        this workspace's asset set differs from the cached APK's
                (1 added, 0 changed, 0 removed; e.g. added
                res/drawable-mdpi/new_logo.png) -- building fresh instead

  and the run does a full gradle build. There is nothing to fix: a drawable
  has a row in resources.arsc that only AAPT can write, so an APK cannot be
  made to carry an asset it was not built with, and installing one whose JS
  references a missing asset would 404 at runtime. Add an image, pay for one
  full build; the APK it produces becomes the new cache entry.

  THE UNINSTALL NOTE is the third, and it COSTS THE APP'S DATA. A re-packed
  APK is signed with this machine's debug keystore, so the moment it meets a
  copy signed by CI the install is refused with
  INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE (or INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE) and
  nothing but removing the package resolves it. A RELEASE run therefore
  uninstalls the package once, retries the install once, and prints

    install     com.example.app was already installed with a different signer,
                so it was uninstalled (its data went with it) before this APK
                could be installed

  Debug runs never do this. A debug run meets the conflict on a physical
  device that already carries a store build, and there the colliding package is
  the user's real app: losing its data to a silent uninstall would be a worse
  bug than the one it fixes. A debug run fails with STIM_INSTALL_FAILED and
  hands you the uninstall to run yourself.

  ON A PHONE the same uninstall costs one thing more: iOS drops the Settings >
  General > VPN & Device Management trust entry when the last app from that
  developer goes, and it clears the app's Local Network permission with it. The
  note says so, because the reinstall succeeds and then the LAUNCH is refused
  until someone taps Trust again. The retry is one uninstall and one install --
  it is not a way around a tap that has no API.

  THE DEVICE FALLBACKS are the fourth, and both print a \`cache\` note and
  build fresh rather than failing:

    cache       a cached Release device app carries its builder's JS, and the
                device JS swap lands with phase 6 of appandflow/stim#178 --
                building fresh instead, which bakes in this workspace's JS

  and a signing-gate refusal on a CACHED artifact -- an expired or foreign
  profile, a phone the profile does not name, an identity this keychain does not
  hold -- which prints the gate's own reason with \`-- building fresh instead\`.
  The same refusal on a FRESHLY BUILT app is a code (STIM_NO_PROFILE,
  STIM_PROFILE_MISMATCH, STIM_NO_SIGNING_IDENTITY), not a note: building again
  would produce the same app and refuse again.`,
    },
    STIM_BUILD_WAIT_TIMEOUT: {
      summary: "waited ~90 minutes for another workspace's build of the same fingerprint",
      body: () => `STIM_BUILD_WAIT_TIMEOUT
  This run was waiting for ANOTHER workspace's build of the same fingerprint
  (see \`guide lifecycle concurrency\`), and no artifact arrived within ~90
  minutes.
  Replacement builders share that deadline, including time spent acquiring
  the lock between waits. A live builder may be wedged, or successive builders
  may have failed. The message names the current pid and lock directory:
  check the pid, and if it is not really building, remove that directory and
  run the command again.`,
    },
    STIM_CLAIM_REFUSED: {
      summary: 'an ownership claim blocks the operation; inspect its holder before removing an unresolved claim',
      body: () => `STIM_CLAIM_REFUSED
  A build lock records the holder's process IDENTITY, not just its pid, so a
  recycled pid reads as a gone builder rather than a live one, and a builder
  busy in a long \`simctl\` or gradle call reads as live rather than as stale.
  This code is the one state that cannot be decided: the claim file is truncated
  or not JSON, its identity token does not decode, or the holder spawned the
  process doing the work and was killed before recording which one.
  Stim will not remove a claim it cannot prove is dead, and it will not wait on
  one either -- a silent wait on a lock nobody holds is what this replaces. The
  message names the claim and the exact, shell-quoted removal that clears it --
  just that claim's file, not the lock directory around it; run that, then
  run the command again. Nothing was built, installed or removed.
  \`worktree warm\` reports it for the repository-wide warm claim under
  ~/.stim/warm-locks on both paths, including a \`--refresh\` that spawned its
  install and was killed before recording which process: nothing was refreshed
  and nothing was copied. A STIM_HOME or warm-locks ancestor that is a file
  also refuses. The message names that blocking path and prints a shell-quoted
  move-aside command. Inspect it first: the file may contain unrelated data.
  An existing backup prompts before overwriting; preserve both files.
  Android creation, recovery and teardown use per-AVD claims under
  ~/.stim/avd-locks. Creation records the avdmanager process group, so a claim
  left by a killed creator becomes recoverable after that group exits. Retry
  after a live creator or cleanup finishes. An interruption before the child
  is recorded, or during synchronous teardown, can leave no verifiable
  identity: inspect the named claim and confirm that neither Stim nor its
  avdmanager or adb child is still using the AVD before removing only that
  claim. Keep the AVD and its incomplete workspace record. Once the claim is
  safe to clear, retry \`stim android\` to reconcile incomplete setup through
  owned-device teardown. GC and project removal refuse while the claim is
  live or unresolved.
  Parked-device adoption and deletion use claims under $STIM_HOME/pool-locks.
  If a holder dies during a synchronous native callback, its child cannot be
  identified and the device stays protected, including from older CLIs through
  an opaque inline marker. Verify that the old Stim process
  and its native children have finished before removing the named claim.
  Legacy inline \`deletionClaim\` fields in config.json have no process
  identity and require separate manual inspection; \`stim guide lifecycle pool\`
  describes their field-only recovery.`,
    },
    STIM_MACOS_OWNER_UNVERIFIED: {
      summary: 'the macOS app owner cannot be verified; no signal is sent',
      body: () => `STIM_MACOS_OWNER_UNVERIFIED
  The recorded macOS process identity is unavailable or its workspace record
  is malformed. Stim sends no signal to an owner it cannot verify. Inspect the
  named process and workspace record before repairing it; do not replace a PID
  or token with another running app. Retry stim stop once identity inspection
  works. See stim guide macos.`,
    },
    STIM_OFFLOAD_REFUSED: {
      summary: 'the selected build machine cannot build this app',
      body: () => `STIM_OFFLOAD_REFUSED

A named --build-machine selection is strict. The message names the machine
and why it cannot take or finish the build: not configured or paired, approval
pending or denied, unreachable or changed pinned identity, incompatible
toolchain/runtime/CPU, low disk, busy, sync/build failure, artifact failure,
or a checkout that changed while it built. Unsupported build kinds also refuse.
No local xcodebuild, Gradle or SwiftPM compile or alternate machine follows a
refusal. Prebuild and pod install still run on this Mac before a named offload.
Unlisted or unpaired names refuse at setup before consulting the cache, without
a build record or failed-run stats. A listed paired name with a cache hit needs
no build and does not contact the selected machine.

Run stim doctor --fix to ask for build access if not paired. Check
stim settings get offload.machines. A person on the worker finds the id with
stim-server devices and approves this Mac with stim-server devices grant <id> --build,
or runs stim-server setup on the worker with its node, ticket and expiry
(guide settings). Agents never run setup or approve requests.
Rerun with --build-machine auto for normal placement and local fallback, or
--build-machine local to keep the build here.

    },
    STIM_CLAIM_UNAVAILABLE: {
      summary: 'a process identity or warm claim store is unavailable, so the protected operation refuses',
      body: () => `STIM_CLAIM_UNAVAILABLE
  Every ownership claim records the holder's process identity, captured through
  the \`unique-pid\` native module. This code is that capture failing: no
  prebuilt binary for this platform and architecture, or the OS refusing to
  report this process's start identity.
  Stim refuses rather than building without a claim. A run with no claim is
  invisible to every other run, so the single-flight lock and
  concurrency.maxBuilds would both be off at once, and two builds could compile
  the same fingerprint while each believed it was alone. Reinstall Stim so the
  module for this platform is present, then run the command again. Nothing was
  built, installed or removed.
  Both plain \`worktree warm\` and \`worktree warm --refresh\` refuse before
  copying for the same reason. A copy without a claim would be invisible to a
  refresh starting after it, allowing the source dependencies to change while
  they are read.
  Warm also reports this code for EACCES, EPERM, EROFS and ENOENT while taking a claim.
  The message names the claim path and original filesystem error. Restore write
  access to the existing claim store, checking parent permissions, symlink
  targets, mount access and sandbox rules, then retry. Do not switch STIM_HOME to evade a claim:
  concurrent runs must coordinate through the same store.`,
    },
    STIM_INSTALL_FAILED: {
      summary: 'simctl, adb, or devicectl refused the artifact; the one signer-conflict retry',
      body: () => `STIM_INSTALL_FAILED
  The artifact built or came from cache, but \`simctl install\` / \`adb install\` /
  \`devicectl device install app\` refused it. A signature or architecture
  mismatch, or a full device.
  On a PHONE (\`ios --device\`) the message carries devicectl's own text and the
  remedy names the cause it recognises: the phone is locked, the host is not
  trusted, Developer Mode is off, storage is full, or the app already on the
  phone was signed by a different team. Only that last one is retried -- one
  \`devicectl device uninstall app\`, one reinstall, and a warning that the
  app's data went with it -- along with the phone's developer trust and its
  Local Network permission, which iOS clears on an uninstall, so the launch
  after it may need the trust tap again. This is gated on \`--device\` rather
  than on the configuration, because every device run is signed, Debug
  included.
  On Android a signature or downgrade conflict names the package that is really
  installed -- the built APK's applicationId, which on a flavored project is
  the flavor's id and not the gradle namespace -- and gives you the
  \`adb -s <serial> uninstall <applicationId>\` that clears it. Re-running after
  that is a cache hit: one install, no build.
  On a REMOTE device (\`--remote\`) agent-device refused the upload or install.

      summary: 'installed but would not start; the developer-trust tap on a phone',
      body: () => `STIM_LAUNCH_FAILED
  Installed, but the app would not start. On Android this usually means no
  launchable activity resolved.
  On a local iOS simulator, a timed-out launch can mean the simulator cannot
  spawn processes, even while it reports Booted. Check the reported memory
  pressure and free host memory before retrying; a timeout alone is not an OOM
  diagnosis. See \`stim guide lifecycle simslim\` for recovery and the optional
  SimSlim recommendation.
  On a PHONE it means the app never appeared in the device's own process list
  after \`devicectl device process launch\`, and the devicectl lines that
  explain it are quoted under the message. The refusal a first launch usually
  hits is the DEVELOPER TRUST one -- SpringBoard reports
  FBSOpenApplicationErrorDomain 3 with the reason Security -- and its remedy is
  the only one a human has to perform on the phone: Settings > General >
  VPN & Device Management, tap the developer profile under DEVELOPER APP, tap
  Trust, then run the command again. It is a per-developer-certificate tap, not
  a per-build one -- but an uninstall clears it, including the one Stim's own

  An app that has not been granted Local Network reaches nothing on the LAN,
  and CFNetwork reports each attempt as NSURLErrorDomain -1009 "The Internet
  connection appears to be offline." with the path reason

    _NSURLErrorNWPathKey=unsatisfied (Local network prohibited)

  THAT REASON IS THE WHOLE MATCH. The rest of the block -- POSIX error 50
  (ENETDOWN), \`failed to connect 1:50\`, \`error code: -1009 [1:50]\` -- is
  generic and says nothing about the permission: Wi-Fi turned off gives the
  identical errno with the reason \`unsatisfied (No network route)\`, and a
  cellular-only route gives \`unsatisfied (Denied over cellular interface)\`.
  Matching those would print this remedy at a phone that simply is not on the
  network, and would drop the same-SSID check that is the actual fix, so they
  are not matched.
  THE PROMPT AND A PRIOR DENIAL READ THE SAME. iOS emits this reason while the
  prompt is unanswered and after a Don't Allow, which persists across upgrade
  installs. The remedy covers both: if the first \`alert get\` finds no alert,
  it was denied earlier and the only fix is the switch under Settings > Privacy
  & Security > Local Network, which has no API.
  The reason is read out of THIS launch's device records -- since the launch,
  and from the app's pid when it is known. It is NOT origin-scoped: the record
  that carries the reason carries no URL (the failing URL lands in a
  continuation line with no process prefix, which the pid filter drops), so
  scoping to this workspace's Metro origin would never fire. That is sound
  anyway, because the permission gates every LAN connection the app makes, so
  even a third-party SDK's prohibited connection proves the app cannot reach
  this workspace's Metro either. Matching only picks the remedy: no record's
  level changes, so the device source stays out of \`logs --errors\`
  (\`guide logs\`: severity is never guessed on a phone).
  When it matches, \`launched: "unverified"\` leads with that evidence and with
  the recovery, in this order:

    agent-device alert get --platform ios --udid <udid>
    agent-device alert accept --platform ios --udid <udid>
    agent-device snapshot -i --platform ios --udid <udid>
    agent-device press 'label="Reload"' --platform ios --udid <udid>

  \`alert get\` reads the alert without opening anything, so it works while the
  app sits behind it. THE GRANT ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH: the dev client does not
  retry, and stays on "Failed to load app ... The Internet connection appears
  to be offline." with a Reload button, which is why the last two lines are
  there. The text form of the press target is \`label="Reload"\` (or
  \`text="Reload"\`); a bare \`press "Reload"\` is rejected. Stim's own launch
  ends in \`-- -EXDevMenuShowsAtLaunch 0 -EXDevMenuShowFloatingActionButton 0\`,
  so the Expo dev menu is not over the app, fresh install or not. An app started
  ANOTHER way does not carry those arguments and \`snapshot -i\` can show the
  menu instead: \`agent-device press 'label="Close"'\` dismisses it, then press
  Reload. See \`guide facts devmenu\`.

  A BARE APP (no expo-dev-client) gets the same first two commands and a
  different third. The prompt fires the same way, because it is fired by any
  LAN connection to the Metro host, and the path reason is CFNetwork's either
  way -- the classifier reads that reason alone and knows nothing about dev
  clients. What differs is the screen: a bare app is expected to show React
  Native's RedBox, "Could not connect to development server". Read the screen
  with \`agent-device snapshot -i\` and press Reload by the ref or label it
  reports; neither that text nor the button's accessibility label has been read
  off hardware.

  \`agent-device metro reload\` does NOT recover either screen. It only reaches
  an app already connected to Metro's websocket, and an app stopped by this
  permission never connected.

  Without agent-device,
  \`xcrun devicectl device process launch --device <udid> --terminate-existing
  [--payload-url '<devClientUrl>'] <bundleId>
  [-- -EXDevMenuShowsAtLaunch 0 -EXDevMenuShowFloatingActionButton 0]\`
  also recovers, and it costs the device log:
  it replaces the process the collector follows, so
  \`stim logs --source device\` stops for the rest of that run. For a dev
  client, pressing Reload is cheaper and keeps the collector alive. For a bare
  app the relaunch is the cleanest recovery, because it re-reads ip.txt. By
  hand it is two taps either way: Allow, then Reload.

  WHAT HAS ACTUALLY RUN: the dev-client path above was performed on a phone --
  the alert, the accept, the unchanged error screen, the Reload press, and the
  bundle that followed. The bare path has NOT been exercised on hardware; there
  is no provisioned bare project to run it on. Its signature and its remedy are
  reasoned from the same CFNetwork evidence and from React Native's own
  RedBox, not observed.

  THE OTHER ONE-TIME TAP HAS NO API. The developer-trust tap (Settings >
  General > VPN & Device Management) is refused to automation by the same gate
  that refuses the app, agent-device's own runner included, so its remedy is
  "ask the user" and nothing else. An uninstall clears both.`,

    STIM_NO_DEVICE: {
      summary: 'no usable phone, or the owned simulator or emulator could not be created or booted',
      separator: '--- DEVICE AND CAPACITY CODES ---',
      body: () => `STIM_NO_DEVICE
  With \`--device\`, no physical device answered the selection: none connected,
  a named serial/UDID that is not connected, several connected with none named
  (the refusal lists them), or one that is connected but unusable -- an
  unauthorized Android device, or an iPhone that is unpaired or has Developer
  Mode off, over a cable or over Wi-Fi alike. Hardware is never created or
  booted, so there is nothing to retry into existence: fix the cable, the
  trust prompt, or Developer Mode.
  Otherwise the owned simulator/emulator could not be created or could not
  reach a booted state. \`stim doctor\` checks the toolchain; \`stim status\` says what
  Stim thinks it owns. Re-running the command creates a fresh owned device
  when the recorded one is gone.
  With concurrency.maxDevices set, it also means Stim could not count the
  booted devices before a boot: a simctl or adb listing failed or timed out,
  usually under heavy load, or other runs held the device-admission lock for
  5 minutes. Retry once the load falls.
  If Android creation says an AVD already exists on disk but is not listed,
  run \`npx stim gc\` to inspect orphaned owned AVDs, then \`npx stim gc --delete\`
  to reclaim those safe to delete before retrying. Keep anything GC cannot
  verify; do not delete AVD directories by hand. A registered unrecorded owned
  AVD is recovered, reusing its existing emulator when its identity is verified.
  If recovery cannot verify registration or process state, inspect \`npx stim status\`
  and \`adb devices\`, then retry after any other run finishes. Keep the AVD and
  its process locks while its state is unverified.
  On iOS a slow first boot is waited out for up to ten minutes while the
  simulator reports Booting or Booted but bootstatus has not completed.
  Booted alone does not end that wait. The failure names the udid and the wait.
  After boot, a process-spawn probe must finish within 30 seconds before
  installation. If it fails, the refusal includes observed host memory pressure
  when available. Free memory before retrying under pressure; see
  \`stim guide lifecycle simslim\`. Booted alone does not prove readiness.
  On Android the emulator's own stdio is captured to
  the global workspace logs/emulator.log (truncated per boot), and when it printed a
  \`FATAL |\` / \`ERROR |\` / \`PANIC:\` line THAT is the message and the remedy
  you get -- the disk-space refusal ("Not enough space to create userdata
  partition") is the case this exists for. The generic toolchain remedy above
  is only what you see when neither the log nor the failure itself identifies
  the cause. An ENOSPC failure points at disk space instead: owned Android AVDs
  normally live under ~/.android/avd, and a booted AVD can use several GB. A
  boot whose emulator process exited is also reported at once rather than after
  the full cold-boot timeout.
  Before a local Android emulator boot, a memory phase line reports observed
  warning or critical macOS host memory pressure. If the initial boot wait
  times out under that pressure and the process this run started is still
  alive, Stim retries the WAIT once for up to 240 seconds more on the same
  serial; it never starts a second emulator. New-device preparation normally
  waits 120 seconds first; the later boot check waits 240 seconds. There is
  no extra wait for normal or unavailable pressure, a process that exited,
  or a process whose liveness this run cannot check. adb probes are bounded;
  final diagnostic queries share a separate budget of up to five seconds.
  A timeout remedy reports observed pressure and the running owned-device
  count when available. Device count alone does not establish memory pressure
  or trigger the extra wait. Stop an unneeded device with \`stim stop\` only
  in a workspace you own, then retry \`stim android\`; ask before closing
  other apps or devices. Specific emulator log errors retain their remedies.

"this project's sim is X, but --device-type asked for Y"
  The project already owns a simulator of a different model, and Stim will
  not silently boot a different one. Reap it (\`worktree remove\`, or
  \`gc --delete\`) and run \`stim ios\` again to create the requested model,
  which loses the old sim's app state, or pass \`--slot <name>\` to create it
  beside the current one. The \`remedy\` field in \`--json\` names the same
  choices.

"this project's sim runs iOS X, but --runtime asked for Y"
  The same refusal for an explicit \`--runtime\` that names another installed
  iOS version than the project's sim runs, with the same remedy. The
  ios.runtime setting alone never refuses; it applies at creation.

"this project's emulator uses device profile X, but Y was requested"

  take that device until it is dealt with), and this workspace's OWN lease with

  are interactive-shaped, so Stim does not make you wait at a prompt. The
  remedy is fixed: stop an environment (\`stim stop\`) to free a device, or
  raise concurrency.maxDevices. A workspace whose OWN device is already booted
  or booting is never refused -- re-running \`ios\` on an environment you

  stopped instead of filling the disk. Nothing was built or booted.

  The message names the free space and the largest uses it could measure:
  Stim state, the shared build cache, simulators, Xcode DerivedData and

  shapes reach this code and the remedy differs. Read it rather than assuming.

  METRO DID NOT ANSWER. The probe timed out after 2 seconds, or the socket
  errored. Nothing is known about the app, so the remedy is to run the same
  reload again, and to check the dev server with stim doctor if it keeps
  timing out. Do not touch the device for this one.

  METRO REPORTS NO PEER FOR THE APP. Stim broadcasts a reload anyway before
  giving up, because matching is best-effort and an unmatched peer may still be
  this app, so VERIFY THE UI FIRST -- the app may already have recovered. If it
  did not, retry: a client reconnects to Metro every 2 seconds, which is also
  this probe's timeout, so a single miss can be a reconnect window rather than
  an app that never connected. If it stays unreachable on iOS, an error in the
  first bundle leaves the app without a packager connection at all and no retry
  will make it a peer. The remedy then routes the agent to the device's own
  controls in its existing automation session: press the error screen's Reload
  button, or open the dev menu and press Reload when no error screen is
  showing. The printed agent-device open command is the last resort; it
  relaunches that app on that device with this workspace's Metro port and loses
  in-memory state. Keep the existing --session flag and verify afterward.

  ADB COULD NOT LIST OR RESTORE THE REVERSE. Before an Android reload Stim
  checks the emulator's adb reverse for the Metro port. When adb cannot list
  or re-apply it, nothing was reloaded; the remedy names the adb reverse
  command to run before reloading again.

  MORE THAN ONE MATCHING PEER IS NOT A FAILURE. A workspace Metro serves one
  app, so several matching peers are that app on several devices. Stim reloads
  every one of them and reports the count in the facts as targets.`,

  working directory
  with no package.json above it, or one whose nearest package.json does not
  parse or depends on neither react-native nor expo, so the directory is not
  an app (the refusal names that package.json and says which of the two it
  is; \`doctor\` reports the same directory as a finding), a \`logs\` query in
  a workspace that has never produced a log timeline (the refusal names the
  nearest registered descendant app with logs when one exists), an
  android/app/build.gradle that declares product flavors with
  no variant selected (the refusal names the debug variants), or a
  \`--device-type\`, \`--runtime\`, \`--system-image\` or \`--device-profile\`
  name that is BLANK or is not installed on this machine. For the
  unknown-name case the installed names are printed in the message -- the
  versions \`xcrun simctl list runtimes\` reports, the models those runtimes
  can actually CREATE (not the whole \`simctl list devicetypes\` table, which
  also names watchOS, tvOS and visionOS models no iOS runtime offers), the
  system images the SDK has, or the hardware profiles \`avdmanager list device
  -c\` offers -- so the remedy is to re-run with one of them. An
  ios.deviceType, ios.runtime, android.systemImage or android.deviceProfile
  setting is checked the same way, and the check applies
  even when this workspace ALREADY owns a device, so a name that could never
  create anything is caught rather than left to a later run. When the bad
  value came from a settings layer rather than a flag, the message also names
  the layer (workspace, repo, committed, or machine) it is set at, since all
  four settings are readable from the machine layer too. The
  \`pixel_fold\` and \`resizable\` profiles on a system image without
  foldable support (SupportPixelFold in its advancedFeatures.ini) refuse the
  same way, since the emulator quits on boot; the remedy names an installed
  image that has it, or an sdkmanager install when none does.
  \`gc --json --cache <name>\` refuses with STIM_BAD_ARG when no shared cache
  carries the name; the remedy names the caches on this machine. \`gc\`
  refuses --cache together with --worktrees the same way.
  A working directory with no package.json above it gets the same
  STIM_NO_PROJECT refusal from \`start\`, \`ios\`, \`android\`, \`stop\`,
  \`reload\`, \`logs\`, \`doctor\` and \`device lock|unlock\`. With \`--json\` the { code, message, remedy } object
  is on stdout, except \`logs --json\`, whose stdout stays empty NDJSON; the
  refusal is on stderr. \`stop\` outside a project refuses rather than
  reporting that nothing was running.
  For a changed Metro pin, run stim stop before retrying, or unset or restore
  the pin; for an unverified supervisor, stop it with the tool that started it. A foreign holder is refused before anything starts; this project's
  own Metro on the pin is attached to. stim web follows the same rules when
  its page uses Metro. ios and android with --no-metro-check use the pin,
  then the recorded port, then 8081, without probing or reserving; an invalid
  pin still refuses.
  These errors are caught before the port is reserved and before any build or
  device work, so nothing was started. The one listing they need
  (\`simctl list runtimes\`, the SDK's system-images directory, \`avdmanager
  list device -c\`) runs only when
  a name was actually given, and a listing that fails is reported as
  STIM_NO_DEVICE naming the tool, never as a crash.`,

    On Windows this is the usual outcome of an interrupt: Node cannot deliver

    its Gradle build keeps the claim until it exits.

  The same locks, held by an ordinary command that is still running, for
  longer than the wait -- 60s by default, 4 minutes for the remote-session lock
  and for \`gc\` deleting EAS sessions under the EAS project lock (its sweep
  skips at once while that lock is held), and ~90 minutes for the \`worktree warm\` lock, which one
  \`--refresh\` can hold for a whole dependency install. The machine-wide EAS
  project lock admits one EAS session start at a time. A \`--remote eas\` run
  waits on it after its build with no overall limit, printing \`lock  waiting
  for EAS remote start (pid 41233, in <workspace>, running for 1m12s) to
  release the EAS project lock\` at once and \`still waiting for ...\` every 30
  seconds. It refuses only when one holder has held the lock for longer than
  the slowest EAS session start (39 minutes), naming that pid.
  The \`worktree warm\` wait prints its
  elapsed waiting time and holder every 30 seconds (\`lock        waiting 40s
  for stim worktree warm --refresh (pid 41233)\`) and the refusal names the same holder
  and the lock directory under ~/.stim/warm-locks.
  A lock whose owner died is taken over automatically (its recorded
  process identity is checked every poll), so this means another Stim command really
  is working on this workspace: wait for it and retry. If nothing is running,
  the message names the lock directory and removing it is safe. The same error
  code also covers the short directory-lock timeout below.

"Timed out waiting for the lock at <path>."
  Short directory locks serialize writes to config, workspace state, device
  leases, ownership records, metadata, and cache manifests. The path identifies
  the lock. These locks wait up to 12s and never expire based on age. When
  another Stim command holds the lock, the message says so: wait for it and
  retry. A failed marker write, such as ENOSPC on a full disk, removes the
  directory it just created before Stim reports the write error.
  Short locks use the same process-identity claims as long operations, stored
  beside the visible directory at <path>.claims. An opaque marker in the visible
  directory also excludes older Stim versions. Only the exclusive claim holder
  can recover a recognized marker. A
  complete claim left by a proven-dead owner is recovered automatically on
  the next attempt. An unreadable or undecodable record instead reports
  STIM_CLAIM_REFUSED and names the claim to inspect; an unavailable native
  identity reports STIM_CLAIM_UNAVAILABLE without running the protected work.
  Older lock directories have no process identity. A visible directory left
  empty before marker publication (a process killed between creating it and
  writing its marker) or during final removal also cannot prove it is free.
  These paths still time out, and the message says no current Stim holds the
  lock and ends with \`rm -rf '<path>'\`. An older Stim version may still be
  using it: if none is running, remove the named directory with that command.
  Standalone Metro and Expo cache packages use the
  same core protocol and do not require the Stim CLI.`,

"port <n> is in use by <holder>; stim start will choose a free port"  (status)
  A note, not a problem: no supervisor of this workspace runs, and
  \`stim start\` reserves a free port when its own is taken. The holder's pid
  and directory are in \`status --json\` under metro.heldBy.

"port <n> is in use by <holder>, so this workspace's Metro cannot serve on
it"  (status)
  This workspace's supervisor runs but another process answers its port.
  Run \`stim stop\`, then \`stim start\`, which reserves a free port.

"stop        refusing to signal supervisor pid <n>: ..."  (stop)
  The records disagree, the saved OS identity is unavailable, or it records a
  port this project did not reserve. If process inspection is denied, retry
  with permission to inspect the processes Stim started. A pid is a number the OS reuses, so it is not
  signalled. The port reservation is KEPT -- it is the only handle a retry
  has. Check \`ps -p <n>\` and \`stim status\` before signalling by hand.

"supervisor pid <n> did not exit within 10s of SIGTERM"  (stop)
  Deliberately not escalated to SIGKILL: the supervisor may be mid-write on the
  very log files \`logs\` reads. The device is left alone and the port stays
  reserved. Re-run \`stop\`, or signal it yourself: kill -9 -<n> (note the
  minus -- it is a process group).

the supervisor could not be verified"  (stop)
"metro       dev server pid <n> left by the supervisor did not exit"  (stop)
  The supervisor is gone but the dev server it started may still run. Stim
  signals it only while its saved identity matches, and on macOS and Linux
  never escalates to SIGKILL. The record and the port reservation are KEPT for a retry. Check
  \`ps -p <n>\`, stop it yourself if it is still running, then re-run \`stop\`.

"teardown failed: <reason>"
  Stim could not release the owned device and keeps its record for a retry.
  \`worktree remove\` exits 1 without removing the worktree while the device is
  still tracked. Fix the reported cause and re-run.

"teardown failed: Owned AVD <name> did not finish shutting down after <n>s:
emulator process <pid> is still running"
  An owned emulator counts as stopped only when no process launched for its
  AVD (\`qemu-system-*\` or \`emulator\` with \`-avd <name>\`) is left in the
  process table. Stim asks it to quit with \`adb emu kill\` and waits 60s.
  Then it sends SIGTERM and, 5s later, SIGKILL. When adb cannot reach the
  emulator, Stim sends SIGTERM at once and waits 60s before SIGKILL. It signals
  only a pid whose command line names the AVD and whose process identity,
  recorded before shutdown, still matches. "(Stim could not verify the
  identity of <pid>, so it sent no signal)" means that identity could not be
  read or no longer matches. Check \`ps -p <pid> -o command=\`, stop the
  process yourself, then re-run the command or \`gc --delete\`. Windows has
  no process-table check and Stim signals nothing there: it waits for the pid
  in the AVD's process lock after \`adb emu kill\`, and refuses at once when
  adb cannot reach the emulator.`,

  A native build rewrites tracked files, and Stim now RESTORES the one class

  (\`<app>/ios/Podfile.lock\`, \`<app>/ios/*.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj\`,
  tracked and unstaged), \`worktree remove\` runs the checkout itself and says
  so per file -- those files die with the worktree either way, and a lockfile
  change anyone meant would have been committed. ONE other dirty path and the
  whole set is refused, churn included, so this never eats real work.
  Untracked \`.watchman-cookie-*\` files, which watchman writes into the roots
  it watches, are not work either: \`worktree remove\` deletes them itself and
  ignores them when it counts dirty paths. Any other untracked file still
  refuses.
  When it does refuse, the refusal PRINTS THE DIRTY PATHS, and the restore
  command under it carries those same paths: run it as printed rather than
  reaching for --force.
  It is built from what git reported, so in a monorepo it names
  \`apps/<app>/ios/Podfile.lock\` rather than an \`ios/...\` example that would
  fail with "did not match any file(s) known to git".
  A setup script that rewrites tracked assets (brand icons, generated config)

  the unfinished install is of the lockfile AS IT STANDS NOW. Without it the
  copy carries a partial node_modules and exits 0, and nothing else in the run
  says so: the refresh reported its own STIM_DEPS_FAILED in its own terminal,

      summary: 'worktree warm copy results, lockfile mismatches, and remedies',
      body: () => `"carry       incomplete: ... ignored entries copied, ... kept, ... failed"
(worktree warm)
  At least one entry could not be copied. The command exits 1 and names each
  failure. Existing entries stay untouched; any files already published remain.
  Inspect failed paths before retrying, because existing directories are skipped
  whole. "complete" means the eligible copy finished, not that dependencies
  are installed or match this branch. Progress and results go to stderr,
  with empty stdout.

"carry       carried <dir>/Pods does not match the <dir>/Podfile.lock on disk here"
  Warm copied ignored Pods from the source checkout, but their Manifest.lock
  differs from the tracked Podfile.lock in this worktree. Warm does not change
  tracked files. Run the printed pod-install command before building directly.
  \`stim ios\` detects a mismatch and runs \`pod install\` for you.

"carry       carried <dir>/Pods but there is no <dir>/Podfile.lock"
  Warm copied Pods but the destination has no Podfile.lock. Follow the printed
  pod-install command before building.

"carry       carried [<dir>/]node_modules was installed from a different <lockfile> than ..."
  The carried node_modules records the lockfile it was installed from (npm
  node_modules/.package-lock.json, pnpm node_modules/.pnpm/lock.yaml, Yarn
  node_modules/.yarn-integrity or node_modules/.yarn-state.yml), and it
  differs from this worktree's lockfile. This fires even when both checkouts
  share the lockfile, because the source checkout itself was not reinstalled
  after it changed. Run the printed install command before building;
  otherwise pod install and native builds resolve the old package versions.
  A pnpm source checkout installed with --filter or --prod also reads as a
  mismatch, because pnpm records only what it installed.

"carry       carried dependencies may be stale: they do not match ..."
  node_modules records no install state Stim can read (Bun, or no record),
  and the source checkout's lockfile differs from this branch's lockfile. Run
  the printed package-manager command before building. A carry whose lockfile
  matches is silent; the warning means a real difference.

  If the source checkout has no dependencies to copy, use this project's
  package manager to install them. Warm does not install dependencies or prove
  the app is ready, unless \`--refresh\` installed them in the SOURCE CHECKOUT
  first; even then the copy can still carry a lockfile this branch does not
  have, which is exactly what these carry warnings report.`,

      body: () => `"npm error code E401 / E404" while \`npx\` resolves the stim package
  The repo probably pins a private registry in \`.npmrc\`, so \`npx\` looked for
  the package there instead of on npm. Use the public registry for this command:

    npx --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org stim <command>

  A line such as \`npm warn exec ... will be installed\` is normal when using
  the no-install form.

"Unsupported engine" from npm, or a syntax error before Stim starts
  Stim requires Node 22.12.0 or later. Stim itself refuses an older Node
  with STIM_NODE_UNSUPPORTED; see that section.


"Found no free Metro port between ..."
  200 consecutive ports are claimed or occupied. \`stim status\` shows what
  Stim knows about; the rest is other software.

"Could not reserve a Metro port after 5 attempts"
  Several commands raced for the same ports and each one lost. Nothing is
  wrong; retry.`,

    sandbox: {
      summary: 'running under a sandboxing harness: EPERM under STIM_HOME, CoreSimulatorService, adb',
      body: () => `RUNNING UNDER A SANDBOX

  An agent harness that sandboxes shell commands typically permits writes
  inside the project and blocks the rest. Three things Stim needs sit outside
  that boundary, and none of the failures names the sandbox:

    EPERM: operation not permitted, mkdir '<STIM_HOME>/workspaces/...'
      writes to STIM_HOME (~/.stim unless set)

    CoreSimulatorService connection became invalid   (macOS)
    Unable to locate device set: ... Code=61 "Connection refused"
      the simulator service simctl talks to over XPC

    ADB server didn't ACK
    could not install *smartsocket* listener: Operation not permitted
      the adb server socket on tcp:5037

  Measured on Claude Code and on Codex: the three fail the same way in both,
  so this is the shape of the problem, not one harness's quirk. Codex also
  blocks network egress by default, which breaks a cache lookup and a fetch.

  \`stim doctor\` names this when a write to STIM_HOME actually fails, not
  merely when a harness that can sandbox is present. \`stim doctor --fix\`
  writes only when the report shows that finding, and only what the finding
  names: the three keys, into .claude/settings.local.json, the per-user file,
  merging with what is there. A report without the finding, with or without
  --platform, leaves that file alone. It refuses under Codex, which
  has no per-path allowance to add, and refuses any settings file it cannot
  parse rather than replace it: comments make one unparseable here even though
  Claude Code accepts them. Claude Code reads project settings from the
  directory a session starts in, so in a monorepo the file has to sit at that
  root to count, and a file written inside a worktree goes when the worktree
  does.

  Two ways out, and choosing at the start of a session beats discovering it
  three failures in. Either run Stim with the harness's sandbox disabled, or
  allow the three. In Claude Code that is settings.json:

    sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite     ["~/.stim"]
    sandbox.network.allowMachLookup   ["com.apple.coresimulator.*"]
    sandbox.network.allowLocalBinding true

  In Codex the sandbox is one flag, \`codex -s\`, with no per-path allowance:
  workspace-write still refuses STIM_HOME.

  A git credential helper is often blocked too. It prints \`failed to store\`
  on a fetch that otherwise succeeded, and is safe to ignore.`,

  Any command can raise it: every command reads ~/.stim/config.json first.
  The file holding every owned-device record will not parse into an object,
  or its projects or repos registry or one of their entries is not an object
  (a bare [], null or number counts as corrupt, not empty), and Stim never

  Any command refuses before it reads or writes state. A relative value would
  resolve against each process's working directory, so the CLI, Metro and the
  Expo build-cache provider would each use a different store. Set the named
  variable to an absolute path, or unset it to use the default. Metro and the

      body: () => `STIM_NODE_UNSUPPORTED  ("Stim needs Node <floor> or later; this is Node <version> at <path>")
  stim and stim-server refuse before loading anything else when the Node that
  runs them is older than their engines floor. Both start through
  \`#!/usr/bin/env node\`, so the working directory can choose that Node: asdf,
  mise and Volta's node shim follow the project's .nvmrc, .node-version,
  .tool-versions or package.json, and nvm and fnm do when a shell hook
  switches versions on cd. A Stim installed with Volta keeps the Node it was
  installed with. Run Stim with a supported Node for that one command:

    ASDF_NODEJS_VERSION=<version> stim <command>
    mise exec node@<version> -- stim <command>
    volta run --node <version> stim <command>
    fnm exec --using=<version> stim <command>
    nvm exec --silent <version> stim <command>

  <version> is 22.12.0 or later. asdf, mise, fnm and nvm keep global packages
  per Node version, so when Stim was installed with npm under one of them, use
  the version it was installed with; asdf names it when it prints "No version
  is set for command stim" instead of running Stim. When that version is
  older than 22.12.0, first install Stim with npm under a supported version.
  The tools Stim starts inherit the override.`,

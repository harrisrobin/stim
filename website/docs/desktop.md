Stim Desktop is a macOS app for watching and steering the work Stim runs:
every workspace with its live simulators and emulators, builds, logs and the
agents driving them. It runs `stim` for you, so it needs the CLI from
[Getting started](./getting-started.md).

## Download

<a className="button button--primary button--lg" href="https://github.com/appandflow/stim/releases/download/desktop-latest/Stim.dmg">Download Stim.dmg</a>

Open the disk image and drag **Stim** to **Applications**. Or use Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask appandflow/tap/stim
```

- macOS 14 or later, on Apple silicon or Intel.
- The `stim` CLI, on your login shell's `PATH` or set in **Stim > Settings >
  App**. See [Install Stim](./getting-started.md#install-stim).
- Xcode 27 for live simulator screens.

The app updates itself. Release builds report crashes to Sentry with file paths,
host names, addresses and credentials removed, and send no screenshots or
performance traces. Every release is listed under
[desktop-v releases](https://github.com/appandflow/stim/releases?q=desktop-v&expanded=true).

## What it does

- **Every workspace at a glance.** Each workspace shows its stage (warming,
  building, running, failed), its devices side by side, and its branch and pull
  request status.
- **Watch and take over a device.** Open a device to see its screen large,
  take it over with your mouse and keyboard, and read what the agent did
  and when. Hardware, rotation and posture controls sit in groups below the
  screen, wrapping when space is tight.
- **Replay.** Scrub back through a device's recent screen, with agent actions
  and errors marked on the timeline. Needs **Serve to phones** in **Stim >
  Settings > Phones**.
- **Simulator options.** While **Control** is on for a running local iOS
  simulator, change appearance, text size, contrast, motion, transparency and
  button borders in its options popover. Values come from the selected device;
  **Refresh** reads changes made elsewhere. Unsupported options say
  **Unavailable**. Requires Xcode's simulator appearance API; audio, location,
  VoiceOver, color filters and Liquid Glass options are not included.
  Its **Development** section also offers **Slow animations** and **Shake**
  where CoreSimulator supports them. Slow animations changes guest UIKit
  animation speed and reads the setting back; Shake sends a shake event to the
  foreground app. Android animation settings are unchanged.
- **Logs.** Separate Metro and App / native inspector sections open the same
  viewer with their source filters selected. Filters remain editable; repeated
  errors are grouped. **Build output > Readable** simplifies Xcode output; **Raw** restores
  every line. Copying and record details retain the original output.
- **Builds.** Structured progress, a resolved Hit/Miss badge beside an actual Cache lookup,
  the reason for a miss, and a prediction of the next build. **Build logs** opens
  all retained raw output for that run, filtered by platform, slot and timestamps.
  Clear the Build run chip to return to generic logs. Run iOS or Android from a menu.
- **Machines.** Select **This Mac** for local disk, memory and cleanup, or a
  configured build machine for its readiness, capacity and build history.
  Click the toolbar's CPU, memory or disk figure for details; **Open Machines**
  in each popover opens the Machines page. CPU covers live workspace processes,
  while memory covers the whole Mac.
  **Link machine** opens the existing **Build Machines** settings flow.
  A removed selection returns to **This Mac**; remote selections have no local
  cleanup actions. Select checklist items to enable **Free space**;
  cleanup previews or confirms the selection before deleting anything.
  Build-cache stats and placement totals use the
  existing local server connection when it allows reads for the same Stim home;
  otherwise they use the CLI. This does not turn on **Serve to phones**. A
  cancelled stats refresh stops waiting without disconnecting device viewing;
  its server read may continue until it finishes or reaches its existing limit
  (normally 60 seconds). The shared connection limits each complete response to
  16 MiB, including its JSON envelope; an oversized response shows a read error
  without retrying through the CLI.
- **Phones.** Pair the Stim phone app, and watch a leased phone from the
  desktop: Android can be controlled, an iPhone over USB is view only. Needs
  **Serve to phones**. On wide iPad and Duo windows, the app keeps its navigation
  beside the main screen; details use the full window. A book fold aligns the panes with the display
  division; a narrow cover screen uses the menu drawer. Duo fold detection
  needs an app built with the iOS 27.1 SDK and an iOS 27.1 runtime.
  On supported phones, light haptics mark menu opening, section and custom-filter
  changes, and successful diagnostic or log copies; scrolling and live updates stay silent.
- **Tablet phone-app layout.** Workspace summary cards use one row when the
  content pane has room for all four, and wrap on smaller panes. Device cards
  stay centered, fill available width up to 640 points, and form extra columns
  only when full-width cards fit.
- **Notifications and cleanup.** Alerts for stuck agents and builds that keep failing, and
  automatic removal of worktrees after their pull request merges. The **Needs
  you** category lists only what agents cannot handle, such as a doctor
  finding, a signing failure or an expired device lease, with **Run**, **Copy
  command**, **Fix**, **Open logs** or **Show in Finder** on its row in
  **Notifications**. It is Silent by default. The inbox starts with 50 matching
  notifications; **Show older notifications** loads another 50. Changing a filter
  returns to the first batch. **Mark all read** and **Clear** apply to all matching
  notifications, including rows that have not been loaded.

Workspace device cards fill the available width up to 640 points and wrap into
centered rows. Each complete card, including its header, fits the canvas height;
additional rows scroll vertically. Screens keep their aspect ratio and a
900-point height cap. Small previews use a 6-point inner inset, while the canvas
keeps 20 points of outer padding. Stopped devices use compact, consistently sized
cards up to 420 points wide. **Boot** runs the device's platform and slot through
Stim, building and launching when needed; the button is disabled while the workspace
has an action running. Unowned and physical devices have no Boot button. Closed web
cards offer **Open** instead. Workspace cards show **Control** for a running
controllable device, or **View** otherwise. Clicking the rest of the card opens the
viewer, with Control already on when the device allows it. Physical iOS devices
and remote previews stay view-only; Android phones require a valid lease and a
control-capable pairing. **Release control** or Escape returns to viewing.

In a live local simulator or emulator viewer, **Show device frame** adds matching
installed hardware artwork. **Hide device frame** returns to the default frameless
view. Frames rotate with the display, preserve its aspect ratio and input
coordinates, and do not require Control. Apple frames use installed DeviceKit
chrome. Android frames use the AVD's configured skin or matching hardware profile
artwork in `/Applications/Android Studio.app`, with matching screen dimensions.
Missing artwork and unsupported skin layouts stay frameless; Android foldables,
physical and remote devices, web pages and replay do too. For a local iPhone Duo,
an installed Xcode with DeviceKit's V68 model and a valid observed hinge angle
enables genuine hardware that follows the hinge and rotation, with input mapped
to the posed active screen. Without that model, the viewer stays frameless.
Desktop snapshots the departing panel before its own posture controls change the
hinge; external handoffs can leave that panel blank or retain an older snapshot.
Stim does not bundle the artwork.

The phone app's bottom toolbar offers **Device frame** for ordinary live iOS
simulators and Android emulators when the paired server supports it. Frames
start off. The Mac sends installed housing pixels to the authenticated read
subscriber; the app keeps its existing guest screen inside the housing's
aperture, so bezel taps send no input. Missing artwork or mismatched rotation
keeps the screen frameless. Phone replay, physical devices, web pages and
Android foldable/circular devices do not use this mobile frame path.

Framed H.264 requires a current Stim phone build with native orientation-clear support; older phone builds keep the video frameless.

For a live iPhone Duo, **Device frame** uses the paired Mac's installed V68 model
when the server advertises `duo-frames`. The Mac composes the hardware and screen
pixels into JPEG images with the observed hinge angle and rotation. A missing
model or angle reading keeps the raw screen visible. Input is enabled only after
the image is displayed, and a drag stays bound to that image's pose. Bezel and
hinge taps send no input. Raw subscribers and recordings are unchanged; turn the
frame off to replay them.

The live local viewer's scale menu defaults to **Fit**. **Point Accurate** maps
iOS points or Android profile dp to Mac points; **Pixel Accurate** maps guest
pixels to display backing pixels. **Physical Size** uses installed iOS device DPI
and the current monitor's reported dimensions, which can be approximate. It is
unavailable without those measurements and on Android; Android dp density does
not describe physical size. Moving between monitors updates the scale.
Accurate modes keep their size when the viewer is small. Scroll outside the device
screen, or release Control to scroll over it; **Fit** always returns to the full
device view. Hardware frames retain the screen scale through rotation. Android
accurate modes use native-resolution images; Fit and wall previews keep their 960-pixel limit.
Duo's projected housing and folded screen, replay, physical devices, web and remote
previews remain in **Fit**.

On the All devices and project wall, active workspaces without running or building
devices use compact cards labelled **No running devices**, with Metro status,
warnings and error links. CPU and RAM stay on the workspace page.

Run, Reload app and Stop from the workspace or sidebar menus keep you on the
workspace page. Open **Last output** or **Operations** for command details,
including failed runs. Click the **Recent builds** label or chevron to expand
the build history. Disclosure content and chevrons animate unless Reduce Motion
is enabled.

An empty workspace shows a purple device floating above a round plinth and a
short launch hint. Reduce Motion stops the illustration's animation.

On a foldable held like a book, the phone app's device viewer places the screen
and replay controls on the leading side of a vertical fold, with Control
toolbars and agent actions on the other side. An iPhone Duo needs a build
compiled with iOS SDK 27.1 or newer and an iOS 27.1 or newer runtime. Android
needs WindowManager fold support. Builds using an older iOS SDK receive no fold
divisions and keep the default viewer layout.

When the phone is partly folded like a laptop and reports a horizontal fold,
the viewer places its title and screen above the fold, with read-only messaging,
Control toolbars, replay controls and agent actions below it. This tabletop
layout uses `react-native-hinges` posture readings and the reserved fold geometry;
without both, the default layout remains. The same iOS SDK/runtime and Android
WindowManager requirements apply.

Actions open a sheet with progress and one completion or failure status. The sheet
stays open until you close it. Expand **Command output** to see the command and
raw output during or after a run; it is collapsed by default. Launch progress
uses **Launching app** and **Verifying launch** labels.

Closing the window leaves Stim Desktop running, so notifications and the phone
server keep working. Click the Dock icon to reopen the window, or press
Command-Q to quit. Command-1, Command-2 and Command-3 open All devices,
Notifications and Machine.

Stim Desktop checks the npm registry once a day for a newer `stim`. When the
`stim` it runs was installed by npm, pnpm or bun and is older, the sidebar
footer says so and **Settings > App > Stim CLI** has an **Update** button that
runs that package manager's update command. It never updates by itself, and it
never offers an update for a `stim` that no package manager installed, such as a
linked checkout.

## First steps

Unless you are already set up, the first launch opens a setup guide that
installs the `stim` CLI with npm, pnpm or
bun, whichever of them you use, and the agent skill, asks for notification
permission and checks Xcode, the Android SDK and a project with `stim doctor`.
Each step shows the command it runs and runs
it only when you press **Run**. The project check lists each `stim doctor`
finding with its fix, and offers **Fix** for the findings `stim doctor --fix`
repairs. Reopen the guide from **Help > Setup Guide…**.

In a project, warm a worktree and run the app:

<StimTabs
code={`git worktree add -b my-feature ../my-app-feature
cd ../my-app-feature
stim worktree warm
stim start
stim ios`}
/>

1. The workspace appears in the sidebar as soon as it warms. Its simulator
   shows in the app instead of a separate Simulator window.
2. Click a device to open its viewer. **Take over** lets you use it; Escape
   gives it back.
3. To use the phone app, open **Stim > Settings > Phones**, turn on **Serve to
   phones** and choose **Pair a Phone…**.

Revoking a paired phone closes its active connections on the next pairing
check. The server checks pairings on changes and once a second.

Stim prints `Open in Stim Desktop: stim-desktop://workspace?path=...` when it
starts work, and coding agents share the same link, so you can jump straight to
a workspace. Settings and other details are in the
[app's README](https://github.com/appandflow/stim/blob/main/apps/desktop/README.md).

## SwiftUI playground for contributors

A DEBUG build provides **Window > SwiftUI Playground** with production notification filters, build
cards and disclosures, simulator appearance controls, Settings scope tabs and design tokens. Named
scenarios cover each view's applicable loading, empty, error, long-text and large-data states.

Run `swift run StimDesktop --playground` from `apps/desktop` to open only the playground, without
starting the normal app's CLI or server. Fixture interactions stay in memory. Compact/regular
viewports, light/dark, large text and increased contrast help inspect layout without
changing system preferences. Release builds exclude it. See the [desktop development guide](https://github.com/appandflow/stim/blob/main/apps/desktop/README.md#swiftui-playground) for adding a fixture.
